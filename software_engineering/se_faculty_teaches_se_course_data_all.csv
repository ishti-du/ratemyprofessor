Overall a boring class in which not that much is learned for which there is not much of an excuse not to get an A+."               ,0 people found this useful 1 person did not find this useful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,report this rating

Exams are reasonably difficult.                                 ,0 people found this useful 0 people did not find this useful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,report this rating
