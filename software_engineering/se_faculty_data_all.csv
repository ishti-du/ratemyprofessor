Professor Boehm has been in the aerospace industry since the 50?s and INVENTED many of the sw processes models. Course materiel a bit scattered through the semester and a lot of information.

Midterm is hard and almost no curve. 2. Final is much much better and more comfortable 3. Bonus are not hard to get if u spend some time 4. Workload is acceptable not so crazy. Going through answer of optional hw is good choice 5.
