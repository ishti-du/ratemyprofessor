      "SWE is very similar to OOP: cold-calling, daily quizzes, an easy solo project, group projects. In SWE, you'll build a website with a group of 4 other people. It's fairly easy to get enough points for a B, but getting more than that requires much more effort. The lectures / tests / quizzes aren't related to the projects, so you still need to study.",
      "Downing's class is well organized and structured, and his lectures are interesting and explain concepts fairly well. If you have anxiety like me, his Socratic method and blog posts, as well as the constant group work probably won't sit will with you. Otherwise I think his class is a good choice, and a great way to get introduced to OOP and C++.",

There were Canvas quizzes every class, and lectures were very important to attend in order to get the most out of the course. There were one solo project and 4 group projects. Overall he is an excellent teacher.",

As long as you go to class, actively review the notes that he posts on his website, and practice the in class exercises before the exams, you'll probably have a good experience.",
      "You will learn a lot in Professor Downing's class, but you will have to put in the work. For Software Engineering, there is a slight disconnect between the lectures and the tasks required to complete the projects, but there is plenty of help available. Lectures involve language-specific details and the project is to build a dynamic website.",
      "Knowledgeable, professional, and engaging. Interactive with the students. He will ask questions on a random students as he writes code. Group work on a web project and learning about python/SQL/javascript. You will learn a lot about coding practices. Daily quizzes can be hard. Tests are fairly easy. Weekly blogs.",

The group project about developing a database website is real world, fun to work on, and rewarding in terms of self-education and worthy of showing a future employer. The tests are quite difficult and are very unforgiving if you mess up. Redemption from a mistake is difficult!",

The quizzes and tests can be tricky, but there are plenty of freebies and extra-credit opportunities for quizzes to make up for it. The main group project is a full-stack website which you'll have to work pretty hard for.",

He gives a quiz at the beginning of each lecture and you have to be in class to get the code to unlock it.",

She had us using several different websites for homework, confusing.",

      "Good lecture notes. Audio notes are available too. There're sample tests online and quite similar to the midterm. He gives you solutions for assignments which is great. Overall he's a good decent prof in CS. The course is hard though but all CMPT courses are hard you know what I mean.",
      "It's a very hard course, but Tony realizes this and does his best to help every student get a good grade. Many profs at SFU pride themselves in making it difficult to get a good grade, but not this prof - he puts many sample exams online to practice on (and the exams are usually very similar) - he makes audio recordings available and all notes too.",
      "Keys to be successful in this course: 1)find a good group mate 2)read the all the notes(every single line) that he posted online! 3)must understand each assignment in order to pass this course",
      "Very friendly and helpful instructor. The difficulty of this course heavily depends on whether or not you regularly go to his office. He posts online notes and audio recordings of each lecture. Tests are hard but not unreasonable. Assignments are easy if you start them early and attend to labs. Everything in the course is well organized.",
      "Barely opened the textbook & never missed a lecture, because his lectures & online class notes are clear, organized, and all you need to know. Assignments were long, but fun & informative. Very helpful, considerate, & thorough when asked questions in person or via email. Warning: he makes typos, so if you think you're right, speak up.",
      "Gives thorough lectures, and gave weekly lecture summaries online. I thought the tests, and assignments were fair.",
      "Good prof, but be prepared if you're taking CMPT 150 or 250 with Dixon; assignments are EXTREMELY difficult and will take many hours (or days!) to complete. Exams are decent. Notes are really great, but he doesn't post them online so go to class! He is very helpful and often stays after class to answer students' questions.",
      "Notes are well organized. Lectures are clear, although it seems boring.(Notes are posted online later) There's a lot to learn in the class, but parts of the assignments are disappointly HARD! Mixed feelings - The prof is great, but again the marks, ...",
      "He is so elegant that can't be described in words. Not only is he a great professor, he is a real man that hardly can be found in our era. He is always glad to help and never let students to be disappointed. He posts his neatly prepared lecture notes on the website. He is really a gret SENIOR LECTURER as his title specifies."

      "I am surprised to see why doesn't have a rating of 4.5+. She teaches in an excellent manner that really makes you understand how your code works. No question is a stupid question in her class, she welcomes extra inquiries and slowly goes over anything you do not understand. She waits outside the class for some time if you have any quick questions. Her notes are organized and she posts the annotated notes online after the class (bless her!). Read over the notes before quiz/test and understand all the iClicker questions and the concepts. That's all you need to good on the exam. Don't forget to practice a lot. There are some websites that let you practice your python skills. She lets you use generous amounts of cheat-sheets so do not stress the exams. Remember Practice is all you need to get A+ in this course.",

      "Diana is a great ComSci prof! Lectures were very clear and easy to understand,even though it is quite clear English is probably not her first language. Every assignment was quite interesting, and the online Peerwise system was a good tool for learning from classmates. Great help was always available in her office hours. TA's however were not great.",
      "Super nice prof, really has enthusiasm for the course & cares about her students. Some concepts she explains very well using slides, diagrams, human model examples, etc. At other times her explanations can lack clarity. Course may be hard to people who have no programming background, since free online textbook can be vague",
      "BEST CS prof imo. Allows cheat sheet, excellent online notes, great explainations, care for students, replies quick to emails. Learned ALOT from her. 2 long projects in semester, and most labs are 'exploratory'. You can partner up with a buddy to split the work for the project. MT and Final were fairly long, but really easy if you can do projects."

Only complaint is he scales up how much you need for a decent grade by quite a bit so be confident that you can get at least 80% if you want something that won't break your GPA. Also check you can run android studio it is a memory hog."

He doesn't hold your hand, and you will have to learn some things on your own), but we're not here to learn online tutorial material. Theory and experience is why we're here.",
      "Very decent. Passionate about the subject he is teaching. Concise explanations and nice British accent. Posts slides online. Midterm was 100% textbook questions, final was 40% textbook questions; difficulty is fair to hard. HW can be challenging. Takes him FOREVER to mark assignments--very thorough about checking for copied HW."
