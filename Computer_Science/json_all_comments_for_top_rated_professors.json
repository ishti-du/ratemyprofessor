Be the change you want to see in the world",

      "Best professor I've ever had!",
      "Sure, the class will make you stressed, but you know deep down that this is a good, productive stress that will turn you into a stronger and better person, which, at the end of the day, is all you could ever want from a class, isn't it?",
      "Kosbie is a phenomenal professor. He's super understanding, and really puts the students first. The course is also really fun. Be prepared to work a LOT, and your weekends will be absolutely shot, but you'll learn a lot and if you do the work it's a fairly easy class.",
      "Best.",

Heck, I didn't even want to do programming before I came, but after 15-112 I am considering double majoring or minoring in CS alongside ECE. Take advantage of this class and learn as much as you can.",
      "I think his class time could definitely be used more productively. The basis of a flipped classroom is that it offers class time to reinforce material, and that has not happened as much as I would have hoped so far. Otherwise, great class, offers you every possible chance to succeed and puts his heart into it.",

Prof. Kosbie wants you to work hard, but definitely not to overreach.",

      "Kosbie is a good professor who's passionate about his work and gives clear explanations of every concept covered. However, his lectures go beyond the scope of the course and his homework requires a lot of time. His midterm exams are relatively easy if you understand the material, and his final exam is extremely easy if you've survived the semester.",
      "Kosbie teaches through experience He does indeed give some intense homeworks that demand 20+ hours of work a week, but in the end the assignments become 2nd nature. Also, he's always there to give the whizz kids challenging problems and is always there for the those struggling to keep up. Always accessible and has tons of well trained TA's.",
      "If you're interested in programming go for Kosbie. There's no one better at explaining and he's by far one of the most helpful and accessible profs here at CMU. But he does give more homework than the other professors and he covers more material so be ready. For those taking this class for &quot;fun&quot; should probably reconsider taking his lecture.",
      "I personally had zero programming experience and was nervous about the subject. But now that the course is wrapping up, I can honestly say that I know how to program. Always entertaining. Good teacher.",
      "Great Prof, but his class is really difficult for people who don't know any programming. In my opinion he is only suitable for CS students, other students should try to avoid him.",
      "Excellent teacher, yet difficult homework. Expect to spend a lot of time doing work, but his lectures are fun and make sense. Once you finish this class, I guarantee you will know a lot about programming and will be ready for 111. One of, if not the best 15100 programming teacher.",
      "Good teacher and very passionate. What he teaches goes way beyond the scope of the course, but teaches the information well. Tough and tedious HW but you WILL learn a lot in this class! -15100"

      "DeNero was able to teach me, someone with no prior experience in CS besides Data 8, the basics of CS very well. He is a hard test maker, but if you study you will be fine because the overall course grading makes up for the hard tests. Pro-tip: Do homework and projects in Office Hours. The course webpage makes it easy to stay on top of work.",
      "The lectures are easy to understand. The homework and projects are designed to be difficult but give you great practice. There are extra questions that are usually much harder than the regular homework, and I would highly suggest you at least attempt them. The tests are difficult, but extremely consistent, so doing practice tests helps immensely.",
      "For a beginner in CS, this course is way too hard. The homework and projects are extremely interesting, but test is way beyond the standard difficulty for beginner's CS course",
      "One of the best professors here at Berkeley. A must take!",
      "John is one of the best professors here at Berkeley. Everyone knows he's an accomplished computer scientist (he created Google Translate) but he remains very humble and makes CS understandable for all. If you want to learn a lot take DeNero. The class is challenging and moves extremely fast but the resources are there to help you succeed!",
      "Great professor, his passion for CS really shone in 61A. Exams can be tricky at times but with practice(especially on past exams) you will get better at solving his exams problems. He is also very helpful during office hours, and he makes sure there are a lot of resources available for you to succeed.",
      "This is a great Prof I met during my university life. He is talent, caring and inspirational. I love computer science since I attended his class.",
      "His lectures are great, and I actually looked forward to the homework and projects.",
      "Awesome professor. His lectures were clear, and he's really good at answering our questions. Gave us life advice at the end of the semester too. Should be easy to get full credit on hw/projects if you start early and make use of piazza and OH. Tests can be tricky, so make sure to do a bunch of practice exams. Grading is pretty fair.",
      "Loved taking CS61A. I didn't attend lectures, just watched the online lectures. The class is pretty fair and they give opportunities for EC - definitely do the EC! I learned a lot and there is lots of support. At the time of writing final grades haven't been given out, but I'm an A-/A.",
      "Daddy. Very clear lectures and very helpful when stuck. the core course material does not really prepare you for the tests on their own though so significant practice and work outside the hw and projects are needed but otherwise very good course taught by a very good teacher.",
      "I took Data 8 with Denero and Wagner Fall 2017 and it is so clear how much effort they put into crafting a really interesting and well-designed class. Denero is charismatic and moves at a good pace in his lectures. He mostly taught the coding portion of the material and was very approachable when I asked questions in office hours.",
      "John DeNero is a legend for a reason. The man truly has a gift for lecturing, explaining concepts very clearly and in an amusing fashion. The content of 61A is very interesting, and the assignments are designed to get you thinking about computer science in a new way. Loved the class, loved the professor.",
      "Prof. DeNero is witty, knowledgable, and patient. He and the GSIs construct an inclusive, helpful environment for all students. There is no shortage of help (Piazza, office hours, lab), though you may have to wait during busy times, like right before a project is due. Try to take coding problems in stride. You learn best through trial and error!",
      "Lots of resources to help you succeed. Clearly outlines the material and lectures are easy to follow. Useful if you have prior programming experience. The midterms and final are fair. They mainly test problem solving abilities. Denero is extremely friendly and willing to help. Some of the projects are a bit awful. HW and labs are generally easy.",
      "The myth, the man, and the legend. This guy somehow manages to simulate a semi-personal connection with each and every student in a class with several hundred students. The course (for the most part) was very well run, and I definitely enjoyed it. He and Adhikari both did an amazing job trying to make the material accessible for everyone.",
      "He's overall a really good teacher. He explains everything relatively well considering it's a pretty intense programming course. The projects weren't too bad as they were just based off completion. Just be prepared for really difficult exams; it's what wrecked my grade in the end.",
      "Professor DeNero is the man, I have never had a professor this good.",

      "His lectures are so great that the online textbook is unnecessary. However, get ready to work plenty if you want to do well. If you can complete all homework and projects on time, you can get 100% on those assignments and even some extra credit, so the only thing in the way are the exams. Be sure to understand the concepts and you'll do fine.",
      "If you can take this class, do it",
      "Overall I liked him but the tests and projects are annoying. They are fill in the blank instead of coding something from scratch. His lectures are good but sometimes I feel like he goes really in depth in order to distinguish people on tests instead of teaching more useful material. Look at last problem on MT2 F2016. Study more than hw and labs.",
      "Great lecturer, funny, informative, his style makes everyone laugh. Might be tricky to catch in office hours; his office gets pretty crowded.",
      "This class affirmed my decision to pursue CS! I loved DeNero's lectures and enjoyed doing the homeworks and projects. The class was an interesting experience, though I'll warn that it is fast-paced.",
      "One of the best teachers I've ever had - a great lecturer, accessible via office hours or email, well-paced syllabus, and funny to boot. Would highly recommend taking a class with him!",
      "Know that CS61A will likely become your 1st priority unless taken P/NP. It's time-consuming & just plain hard for people without programming experience (expect 20+ hrs/wk), but doable and very interesting, and his lectures and course design are what make it work. So don't take it with another hard and unrelated class. Like an MCB upperdiv. haha fml",
      "It is possible to do well in this class. Professor DeNero is a great teacher and he provides the resources to succeed in his class, you just have to work hard and study. It is pretty helpful to have prior programming experience, but if you put in the work, you don't have to. Great class and great professor.",
      "The class is very well-organized, but it covers a lot of content (prior programming experience is almost necessary). Also, exams are require you to think outside the box and test things that you may not have thought of. Professor DeNero is very knowledgeable, explains difficult concepts well, is an engaging lecturer, and makes a large class work.",
      "Not as good as hug but still a great CS prof",
      "Professor DeNero is incredibly friendly, accessible and inspirational. Even though his course will make you work reasonably hard, if you put in the time and effort, you can get a high score on his exams.",
      "John DeNero is a great lecturer and teacher. He explains things clearly, with the occasional joke. The midterms are hard.",
      "Such an amazing professor, I love his class even though it's pretty challenging for me. Provides a ton of support and the projects are super fun! He's also a funny guy and gis lectures aren't boring at all, so that's a plus!",
      "Definitely the best teacher I've had at Cal. He was organized, entertaining, and obviously cares a lot about his students. His class was a blast and made me want to be a CS major.",
      "Great professor. The class isn't an easy A and the exams do require a great deal of studying, but you learn a lot from the course.",
      "He's great at making the class interesting and really trying to spark the interests of his students. He also genuinely cares about each individual student despite having more than 1000 to deal with. His lectures are informative as well as funny, and he doesn't overload you with work. It's a hard class, but he tries to get you the support you need.",
      "He is AMAZING! Everything you could want in a professor :) Him and his army of TAs really made this 1400-person class work.",
      "Simply Amazing. Funny. Clear. Tall. The class starts out very easy but picks up waaay too fast and the second midterm and final killed me.",
      "Amazing professor, cannot be easy to teach a class of this size, and you won't get any face time with Denero. Nonetheless, you come out of this class, changed.",
      "Legend. Immortal. Amazing. God. Life-changer. Even if you end up failing the class, you won't regret taking CS61A. Why? Because of DeNero. He's a gem. Seeing him outside is like seeing a celebrity. I hope he keeps on teaching CS61A.",
      "DeNero is a great professor! He makes a conscious effort to make sure students are succeeding in his classes. He is super willing to help and will help student with trivial problems like internet connection issues. He makes what would be an impossible course simply difficult. Would recommend 61A to students from all majors, definitely memorable!",
      "One of the best cs professors you could take at Berkeley. I don't enjoy programming, but his enthusiasm for the subject makes this class fun and interesting. He's also understanding of the fact that this is a hard class with a heavy course load. He doesn't like seeing students do poorly and he'll help you if you ask for it.",
      "DeNero is to this day the most inspirational and wonderful lecturer whose class I have had the privilege of experiencing. He is so understanding and helpful. 10/10 recommend any class with him.",
      "DeNero really works for his students, and is one of the best lecturers I've ever seen.",
      "Awesome class, nicely structured, and very organized. He's got an amazing sense of humor and you can tell he really cares about the subject. Compsci is not an easy topic (Berkeley CS is a hard dose of reality for a lot of normally good students) but you will walk away learning something.",
      "DeNero is one of the most amazing professors ever! He's really good at explaining difficult material. I came in to this class with no previous coding experience and since the class was very hard I constantly thought about dropping, but I stayed because of DeNero. He and the course staff work really hard to provide resources for struggling students.",
      "Denero is an absolute gem. This is my first time coding and I am having so much fun with it because his lectures are amazing and the assignments are incredibly well-crafted. He is the best teacher I have ever had",
      "Heaven on a Professor.",
      "Best professor for intro CS. Could be the best professor I've ever had. I became a TA for this class in large part due to him personally. If you're here you probably are already planning to take this class, but if you're not sure yet: take this class. One note: go to his office hours. For a 1000 student class, they're somehow always empty.",
      "CS61A was an incredible class. There were over 900 people enrolled, but I had more opportunities for personal assistance than in any of my smaller classes. John is an awesome professor - fun, interesting, and helpful. His online videos are very clear and precise (more so than any professor's physical lectures). Definitely would recommend.",
      "Best person you could ask for your first CS class at Cal. Expect to spend a lot of time on projects and homework and studying for tests, but GO TO OFFICE HOURS. The TAs are very helpful, remember that you're not alone on this. I've gone to every lecture, you can watch the videos online but live lectures are great. Hilarious and answers questions",
      "Bruh this dude more fire than my mixtape.",
      "There are 3 times in life I felt so bad about losing someone. The first time is when my ex-girlfriend left me and went to another city. Second is when I stepped into the airport after visiting a good friend who I couldn't see for years . Third time is on Prof. John DeNero's last lecture.",
      "John really cares about his students. Teaching the biggest class on campus, he really makes an effort to make sure each individual gets the attention they need. He is a great lecturer and he tells you NOT to come to lecture and to just watch the webcasts. Amazing. Perfect guy for students' first CS prof when they come to Berkeley.",
      "I've never rated a professor before, but, like Yeezus, this man is a god.",
      "Simply amazing.",
      "OMG He is my fav prof. I believe everyone who has taken cs61a with him would LOVE computer science.",
      "Great professor. Great class. Take it.",
      "Denero is an amazing professor. His online video lectures are far better than live lecture. However, learning in this class really comes from surviving the constant inundation of homework, quizzes and projects. Doing previous exams are essential for success on his exams.",
      "I felt blessed to have taken this course. I barely had any programming experience before and DeNero simply guided me through. His webcast lecture was probably the clearest I have ever seen. Homework and Discussion handout were helpful. The first midterm was fair but the second midterm kind of shocked us all but he was quick to react and adjust.",
      "Homework is graded based on effort, Labs and Discussions are only worth points if you are literally killed by the test, and tests can be hard. DeNero is ridiculously smart and a great lecturer and I enjoyed the class. Put in the time (DO THE DISCUSSIONS) and you won't be sorry.",
      "Denero is amazing. His lectures are very helpful and he keeps them interesting and fun. Lectures are most commonly viewed online, which is also helpful. You'll definitely learn a lot in this class and help is readily available via office hours and online resources. On the other hand, the work load for this class is large that the exams are tough.",
      "John Denero is fantastic. He is loved by students. His (massive) course is extremely well organized. Most of his homework and projects are useful. Lecture videos are posted online, and are very good. Biggest downside is that it's a hard course. I came in with a lot of prior experience and did fine, but I still had to study and practice quite a bit",
      "CS 61A is a difficult class, but professor Denero's humor and enthusiasm made it much bearable. He is an inspiring lecturer and you can tell he really cares about his students.",
      "DeNero is a great teacher for 61A. It was a fun class and he taught us python well. Didn't like Logic but he made python a joy to learn.",
      "Best teacher ever! I went into the course without any programming experience and so far he's made the material extremely accessible. He's a super nice and chill guy as well, go check out his office hours and hang out with him, or if you have questions about NLP or even industry vs academia, DeNero is your guy",
      "John DeNero was incredibly clear, and he was a fantastic lecturer, especially considering that over 900 students took CS61A in Fall 2013. All of the lectures were filmed in advance, so it was not even necessary to go to lecture. He genuinely cares about all of his students. However, the class itself is quite challenging.",
      "Fantastic online presentation, fantastic lecturer, has WONDERFUL TAs, really know howto organize and present concepts and got me into coding! I'm really glad my major requires this class, and am grateful to have taken this class and learned so much from him! That said, no programming experience makes this class very painful, especially projects.",
      "DeNero is an awesome lecturer and really makes all the content easy to read and understand. But don't think you can just skip lectures and not study.",
      "John Denero's lectures, materials, and assignments, and course as a whole could be best described as an unparalleled masterwork of education. Simply put, this guy can turn any willing human being into a computer scientist. Flawless educator.",
      "John explains everything in a way that the course material just clicked in place. Came in with negligible programming experience and ended up with an A+ in this class. He gives lots of chances to pass this class and earn points (including extra credit). Favorite class ever!",
      "Fantastic class and great professor! Very clear and organized. I think the best part about this class is even though it is formally an intro course, even experienced programmers will learn and find his class interesting by focusing on the programming mindset and problem solving skills necessary to be successful in CS. Strongly recommend this class!",
      "Phenomenal teacher--lecture is clear, tests are challenging but not impossible, class is super-structured and organized, and it's obvious he enjoys what he does",
      "John is a God! Great teacher and so passionate! One of the clearest lecturers ever! Loves Computer Science and you can tell he loves to teach. Projects and homework are doable. Very hard class(tests especially) if you're knew to coding but hard work pays off...",
      "Great professor, very articulate. And nice guy as well!",
      "Best Professor I've Ever Had, and will always be one of the greatest.",
      "One of the best professors I've had at Cal, and the reason I'm majoring in CS. Even with 1000 students, he found a way to make it work.",
      "Brilliant teacher. Really knows what he is talking about. Lectures are funny and very informative. Homework and projects are challenging but so worth it. Hands down, one of the best teachers I've seen. Ever."

      "One of the best professors the University of Washington could offer. I never thought of majoring in CS/CE but I seriously considered it after taking the class. His lectures are very fun, polished, and informational.",
      "Stuart is a veteran in cs, but he is the common student's professor. Makes computer science accessible even if you don't have any previous experience. Lectures are enjoyable, as you don't really need to take notes and he has a good sense of humor. CS 142 is a tough class, but easily manageable if you stay up to speed with lectures.",
      "I would recommend using the book to do practice problems. I did lots of practice it (UW online java practice programming problems) and honestly even though it helps I only got a 3.4 because I honestly wrote messy code in the two exams, and lost points on the hard programming question for both exams. I would advise use the textbook.",
      "I've really enjoyed Reges, he's funny, but most importantly very good at explaining the concepts we are learning. Even though CSE 143X is a fast course, he has made it possible to keep up by being very decisive in his lectures. He also tells you all the important things you need for the tests and homework. I haven't really had to read the textbook.",
      "Reges is a very inspiring professor to learn from. Admittedly, I had him for a seminar class and not a 14x course, but he consistently blew our minds with new concepts. He's also a great guy to talk to overall as he's very down to earth despite his legendary status. Take the 143 honors seminar if you can - it will change your life.",
      "Not to hard to get 3.5+ as you do a lot practiceit problems everyday that are related to whats gonna be on the test. Also make sure to practice every single type of question on the test and that you know how to do them. Tests aren't bad as long as you practice ALOT for everything. As for homework just make sure you read the specs carefully.",
      "Getting a good grade is not too hard in this class. His tests are very straightforward and he often recycles a big portion of the questions that are on the test. One nice thing, when I took the class, 50 percent of the final points were questions from his archive. But if you want to do well in his class, you need to study everything on this tests",
      "Reges' lectures were hands down the best lectures I took all my education career (and I'm currently a doctoral student so I had quite a bit) I'm glad he was the one who laid down my programming fundamentals. Very tough grader so my GPA did indeed took a hit but I never would have changed his course for anything else.",
      "Excellent lectures. Difficult to talk to outside of class. Only ever attended the first lecture. Panopto is awesome.",
      "Decent lecturer but a bit overrated in my opinion. Pretty rude and not very accessible too. Grading is mostly based on a series of arbitrary style deductions including things such as use of advanced concept as point deductions. I got a pretty good grade but truly believe the 14x series is poorly designed.",
      "Great teacher and super based guy - in fact he used to be director of the libertarian party. If you're trying to get into CS you really need to get a high grade in this class. (142/143)",
      "This is a HARD class. Stuart didn't fail to deliver in teaching the class; he's a funny and very interesting person which made lecture enjoyable. I think a few things about the course itself (which Stuart made) could be revamped though. For example, binary trees need to be introduced way earlier for any chance on getting good a final grade.",
      "The intro CS classes are meant to be weed out classes, so not easy, but definitely a class where effort correlates with grade. He is one of the best lecturers I have had at UW, but not one of the most approachable. Style points on the homeworks are a huge grade killer. I received a decent grade because I did a ton of Practice-It before exams.",
      "I had Stuart for 142, 143, and the 143 honor's discussion. He is an awesome and incredibly knowledgable prof, and funny too. He doesn't put up with nonsense but I really enjoyed all of his classes. Take his honor's section if you can because it was crazy cool getting to know him on a personal level outside of lecture. Great prof would take again",
      "He is the mastermind of CSE 14X is the best lecturer in the series. His lectures are amazing and usually come straight out of the textbook, which make the textbook optional, but a great choice to review his material for homework. Stuart is a love him/hate him professor and most people love him!",
      "Stuart is a great lecturer, and the homework assignments are actually fun projects. Be prepared to lose a lot of style points. It's a really challenging course but it's worth it. The exams are very predictable and he's very upfront about what to expect if you do old exams.",
      "This is my second class by Stuart and I enjoyed it even more than the first. The homework was brilliant, it breaks you down for a couple over hours before the \"aha!\" moment when you understand a subject. Stuart is also funny and lets the TAs sneak in little jokes in assignments.",
      "Stuart is an amazing professor who is genuinely unique. He may be more difficult than other professors if you're just starting off with CS, but he has such a unique way of explaining concepts.",

Stuart's lectures are funny, he adds references to shows I like (wubalubadubdub!) and there is a ton of practice material for the exams. Get ready to lose some style points in this class, and for good reason!",
      "Stuart is an entertaining guy-- his lectures are interesting enough to keep you awake and he does a good job at introducing hard Java topics to complete beginners. The only issue was the grading system used for the homework which sometimes seems rather ridiculous. Overall, I learned a lot in Stuart's class and really recommend taking him.",
      "Reges himself is really funny. He can waste time from time to time talking about facts irrelevant to the course, but it can be interesting to some people. The problem is the TA selection and the ambiguity in the grading. The grading is really harsh on homework, but on the exams it's really fair. The TAs are undergrads so they can be incompetent.",
      "Professor Reges is a great professor! His lecture is always interesting and the knowledge is showed extremely clear. He often said analogies and jokes in lecture. And after lecture he will answer students' questions if you come to ask him.",
      "Let me be clear on this: I think Stuart is a good teacher. My main issue is really with how the course is designed. I think that having 50% of your homework grade based on arbitrary \"style\" points is ridiculous and seems to be an excuse to create grade deflation because of how competitive UW's computer science department is.",
      "Stuart is hilarious! Definitely one of my favorite professors. You'll do fine if you go to lecture and do the work. My only complaint is that most of his analogies are about fridges.",
      "Best lecturer I've ever had. If you go to class and pay attention, he explains things so clearly that you won't even need to read the textbook. If you understand it, the homework doesn't take too long but is graded pretty strictly. He's pretty good about taking questions but the class is so big that going to the IPL for help is a better bet.",

      "Really interesting teacher",
      "The best way to excel in this class is by practicing minimum 5 problems of Practice it everyday. I did not do great on the midterm but started practicing everyday for the final and did really well on it. Other than that he is a great lecturer. He has a tendency of doing tough concepts right at the end though.",

It was my first time programming and I was very confused at the beginning which is why I got a bad grade on the midterm and an average grade over all. Quiz section taught me more than Stuart for sure. Wasn't that interested in the subject at first but now I love it!",
      "Glad I signed up for the lab (1-credit CSE 190). You can lose very easy points for the homework because of \"style points\". Stuart Reges uses analogies so you should read the book and do practice-it problems BEFORE attending the lecture. Also you should go to Autumn 2015's CSE 142 website to do the homework 1 and 2 BEFORE day 1 of class. Hard exams.",
      "Stuart is a great guy. Just expect to spend a lot of time with hw. You will stress out about hw if you care about your grade because you can not fck up simple things or it will hurt you like a mthrfckr. Also, there is no curve at least for my quarter. I recommend that you prepare to take two easy courses along this course especially4 1st qrter",

      "This class has some students with java experience, \"hares\". Make sure you do practice-it problems before each lecture, as the metaphors may help - or not. Quiz sections depend on your TA, some are good some are more useless. Sign up for the CSE 190 lab- handy when you need help with some conceptual questions. Lectures recorded in CSE 142 website.",

His analogies are a hit or miss. Oh and he sometimes makes inappropriate jokes or just passes comments that are rude.",
      "Dr. Reges is pretty fantastic. CSE 142 is designed for people who have never touched computer programming before, and he does an amazing job of teaching from the ground up. He usually stays a while after lecture to answer any questions. His lectures are essentially quoted from the textbook, or vice versa, so both are great ways to learn.",
      "Great lecturer overall. Before taking 142, I had no idea about how to program but I felt that Stuart walked me through the basics of Java very well. His cookies are very good so good that I think that he bakes them with weed ;)",

Class was fun and challenging. Even if you're not a computer science major, I recommend trying this class. Textbooks are useful, but not necessary.",
      "The best lecturer ever in my whole life!",
      "He is a GREAT professor! Lectures are clear and interesting. But coding is more of your own work. You need a lot of practice to get a high grade on this course. Attendance are not mandatory but you need to go to them to have a better understanding. Overall it's great but it is really hard for an intro-level course. Have to put in lots of efforts.",
      "Awesome professor. Do the work, study for his tests, and you can definitely get a good grade.",
      "Reges is hands down the best professor I've taken a class with at the UW. I had no programming experience before taking 142 but by attending lecture and doing homework I got an A in the course. Reges has great analogies that really helped me understand a lot of the topics covered (wish I could say the same for my 143 prof). If you take CS, Reges!",

      "I never took a CSE class in high school so the material was entirely new to me. I had to do a lot of reading and practice problems to keep up with everyone else and the pace of the class. However, during lecture Reges is AMAZING! He's very clear, has a sense of humor, and is passionate about the topic. Learn to debug your programs.",
      "Reges is a veteran prof and one of the best in the field. He designed pretty much the whole CS curriculum and he is the best prof you can have for 142143. His lectures are absolutely amazing and helpful for both tests and homework. 142 is a weedout class so grading is artificially hard, pay attention to style. Go to IPL and talk to TAs",
      "Great professor, loves his jobs and shows in lectures. Get a head start on the homework, don't wait until two days prior to start.",
      "Awesome lecturer, he is clearly passionate about teaching this course and has excellent explanations. The grading is very specific and unbending, double check all your assignments, do practice-it (the textbooks online practice website) and you'll do fine. Highly recommend the class.",
      "Stuart is an amazing prof. He is really excited about CS and uses amazing non-technical analogies to explain techie concepts. He really sets you up for success in hw during lecture, so go to class! The textbook is essentially the same, & if you want to do well on tests, start early, do Practice-it the entire quarter & take lots of practices tests.",
      "Great class! It's not too hard if you put a little effort into learning the subject matter. Homework can be frustrating because if you do not do it their way, you'll lose points, but you can ultimately understand why they grade it that way.",
      "This class with Reges was amazing! Everything was explained very clearly and the lectures always captured my attention. You can tell that he is passionate about his field and I've never felt more interested in majoring in CS than after this class.I really enjoyed taking this class, although some of the grading on the assignments was kind of harsh.",
      "Absolutely hilarious lecturer. Good at explaining concepts in a funny way. Really helpful. I enjoyed his lectures.",
      "Professor Reges is very funny in class and keeps the topics interesting so that the class won't get too technical to a point that is boring. He gives metaphor that makes programming really easy to understand(though some of them are cheesy). Some say he is a harsh grader, but if you pay attention in lecture and go to quiz sections,easy A.",
      "Stuart is great! He really likes what he is doing and that really shows. His assignments are just amazingly fun puzzles to do every week. I really appreciated his non-technical examples. For CSE majors, pay attention to the complexity stuff because I regret not listening as much. Go to the IPL and do the honors 14x section if you can!!",
      "A very good professor. He explains everything clearly. One very good tip to study for midterm and final: go over ALL old midterms and finals that he provide and understand them, because there's a high chance that they will appear on your test (8 of 10 questions were reused for Winter 2014 final exams)",
      "Very interesting and fun class.",
      "He's a great lecturer and teaches the material with passion and clarity. However, he tries to weed out too hard, often in bad ways. You *will* lose points on homework for style and his tests are structured like so: 70% of it is easy and the last 30% is meant to make most people fail. Note: he reuses most of his material from past quarters.",
      "Stuart does a great job explaining how to do the homework and how to prepare for the tests. The only difficult part is not losing style points on the homework, which can be challenging at times.",
      "Stuart is a great professor! He's enthusiastic and makes the interesting material even more fun to learn. The homework isn't bad at all, I usually finished in 1-2 hours. Easily my favorite professor and course at UW!",
      "Stuart was a very good professor. In section X we moved very quickly through the material, but I think Stuart did a very nice job, overall, of getting the information across. My biggest piece of advice for this course is to put a good amount of effort into the homework, because it will help your grade at the end if you are not a great test-taker.",
      "Best professor I've had! His class never gets dull!!",
      "Great professor. I loved going to lecture. Material was interesting and well paced for a student who had never been exposed to programming before.",
      "Great intro lecturer, coming in with no experience he's great at explaining exactly what you need to know. Don't miss lecture though otherwise you will have to work to make up points",
      "For this class, each HW will consume about 3 - 5 hours and he'll give you a week long. Exams are straight forward with questions similar to quiz sections. Book is useless since everything you need will need will be posted online. He is very clear in explaining the lecture and what he is expecting you to do. Good professor, recommended.",
      "Excellent Professor",
      "I am taking Stuart's class right now. If you have never programmed before, it's going to take you way out of your comfort zone. CSE is whole new level of thinking. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't take the class. Stuart loves teaching and he's funny as well. He tries to be as clear as possible. Homework took me about 3-4 days to complete btw.",
      "Best professor I have had yet at the University of Washington. I'm never bored in class, never have to read the textbook because of his great lessons and explanations, and he always has a good joke or two",
      "I LOVE Stuart Reges!! He is honestly the most enthusiastic professor that I have ever had and he makes me want to go to class more often than not. I have never felt this way about any course I have taken in the past and I am so unbelievably glad that I have gotten the chance to be taught by this man. Twice, even! CSE 142 & CSE 143! Thank You!!",
      "Genius of analogy",
      "I hope I fail this class so I can take it again and again",
      "One of my favourite professors so far. His lectures basically give you everything you need to know and has a great sense of humor.",
      "I hated programming before taking this class. I am now pursuing computer science. Enough said.",
      "Super clear, explain things very well. Love his analogies. Class is engaging. Wants the students to think the same way as he do, which is sometimes not very good. Usually reuse worksheet problems on the exam. Overall, Great professor.",
      "I'll put it this way, CSE 142 was the hardest class I've ever taken at UW. Other math and science classes went reasonably well for me. There is a catch, if you find your brain is wired to code, this will be a very fun class. If not, it will be brutal. Unfortunately, as far as the class went, I was one of the few who didn't quite ever get it.",
      "Stuart was a great professor, one of my favorites so far. He isn't easy, but no CS class truly is. What he does bring to the table is his wonderful talent for providing clarity in his explanations of concepts in class. Don't skip. The lectures are definitely worth attending for his good use of examples and occasional witty moments.",
      "Reges was my first CS teacher, and after finishing the 2 introductory class from him I became a CS major. He is clear and gets occasional laughs from the class. The workload is not too heavy, and no prior programming language is required for 142. Recommend.",
      "This is a hard class. I took AP Computer Science in high school but opted for a swimming class after the first semester. Computer science is a difficult subject. However, Reges is very clear when he explains things and this makes the class much easier than it could be otherwise. Highly recommended.",
      "Great professor who's very passionate about CSE. He's pretty amusing and keeps you awake. You don't technically have to be \"naturally born with talent\", you just need to able to work independently and spend time to understand what you learned and how to apply it.",
      "Awesome lecturer, shows great interest in subject and excellent use of analogies and examples make is possible for anyone to understand. I don't buy the &quot;if you're not naturally gifted at CS you'll do bad,&quot; crap. To succeed in this kind of class, you have to put in a lot of time outside of class.",
      "AWESOME PROFESSOR! Interesting, clear, concise, gives excellent analogies and explanations. Posts clear lecture notes and practice exams online. Class is curved so easiness has nothing to do with professor, so its hard to get a high grade. TA-led quiz sections and out-of-class practice crucial to success. Really anal on how homework is graded.",
      "Yes, the class is hard and he is a genius. Yes, he's arrogant but he deserves it (totally). Yes, he's involved with MDA or whatsoever. I mean... Who cares. If u always expect a perfect teacher who is humble, gives reasonable exams, n have no controversy, u're living in the never land or u're a twilight fan...",
      "This class is pretty hard if you're a nonmajor and don't think like a computer scientist, though through no fault of Stuart's. The guy is nothing short of a genius and teaches very well. I just found the content very difficult while many of my peers breezed through the class.",
      "Extremely precise and engaging; exactly what a CSE professor should be",
      "Reges is awesome!! He cares about what he's teaching, and he loves teaching. There is more than ample practice and advise offered, all you have to do is make use of the resources and you should do fine. I loved the programming assignments, even if at times they could be frustrating. Both cse 142 & 43 were great w/ Reges.",
      "A great professor! Reges is a genius and he is well aware of that, so I see why some people might mistake geniusness for arrogance. He is strict with grading, however if you attend lectures and sections do homework you have nothing to worry about! Also, his lectures are usually very interesting and he is very passionate about teaching!",
      "Probably my favorite professor at UW so far. Not an easy class, the tests were pretty hard, but I learned so much, and Regis had an entertaining way of teaching! I loved this class!",
      "The GOOD: entertaining lectures, good explanations, and he starts on-time and won't waste you're time in class. The BAD: Even if you are generally a good student, the tests are stupid hard. As in HARD. It's not enough to read the book, read lecture notes, and do the homework--you need natural talent. Welcome to UW.",
      "Stuart is a boss, I highly recommend him whether you have prior CS experience or not. I took the class originally to fulfill a prereq but grew to the love the subject. The material can be tricky, but if you put sufficient effort and attend lectures/sections you can get a good grade, even if you've never wrote a line of code in your life.",
      "the teacher is very good however if you arent for programming then you have to work very hard... i took cse the second time and i didnt do that good. I think im just not for programming... i spend like 2-3 days to finish the hw.. the exam is pretty clear.. he lets you know the format of the exam.. i recommend to take reges class",
      "I had never programmed before, so I really appreciated his clarity and straightforwardness. He's also really funny in an awkward way =] I highly recommend this class.",
      "Good teacher for those who had never even attempted to program before.",
      "Crystal clear, articulate, and approachable to discuss concepts. His exams are always fair - though they will test you under high time pressure. He has a good knack of explaining why a theory or operation is relevant and where it fits into larger perspective - which really helps you think. Be prepared to work a bit in his class, though.",
      "I had Reges for 142 and 143. His lectures were pretty laid back but very useful. If you attend his lectures, you don't need to read the book much (although it's def still a good idea, esp. complexity and some other chapters). Some exams have a lot of time pressure, though, depending on your ability to think on your feet, so beware.",
      "One of the best lecturers I've had; he's hilarious, interesting, and great at providing analogies of difficult concepts. Very nit picky on homework though, especially in intro classes, and even for silly things like comments. Tests are tough, but follow a predictable format. Ensure you are proficient with exam type questions. Final = 40% of grade.",
      "I've had him for 143 and 341. Best professor I've ever had. Clear, articulate, prepared; he types up his class notes for you, and goes into special topics to keep it interesting. It's hard work, but worthwhile. Note that in his intro courses the syllabus he gives you shows the *minimum* percentage to get a grade; often 85% gets a 3.5.",
      "Generally agreeable guy in person and a pretty good lecturer. I had him for 143 and Stepp for 142, I prefer Reges. Assignments are hard, but if you go to lecture, there's nothing in them that you shouldn't get.",
      "Stuart is a nice guy! :-) :-0 ;-)",
      "Very clear lecturer and a very understandable textbook. This class is effing hard though. You have assignments every week that take forever and the midterm and final are very hard. Of course I may just be retarded, but I thought this was one of the hardest classes I've taken. I guess it just depends on whether you get programming or not.",
      "Reges is good with language. His lectures and textbook are both very good. You don't need prior programming experience, Stuart assumes you know nothing and explains everything. I didn't have programming experience and did better than many who did. Grading is easy if you adhere to assignment guidelines and do at least 3 practice midterms/finals.",
      "very hard class. the assignments are difficult. you must score above a 90% on everything in order to get an A. Confusing material. not recommended unless you need it for credit",
      "You need to pay attention and know what the hells going on otherwise the last 40-45 minutes of class are going to be useless.",
      "Awesome professor - very clear and engaging. However, must warn students about the difficulty of the class. You pretty much have to score 92%+ consistently on all homework/midterms/etc. in order to even be close to an A.",
      "I totally wish I had him as a teacher back in AP Computer Science in high school...Stuart is a wonderful teacher and his textbook Back to Basics is probably the best Java textbook EVER. Lecture is very engaging with plenty of interesting tidbits to keep you interested (Asciimation Star Wars, Knuthian hexidecimal dollar etc). MUST TAKE.",
      "The assignments will challenge you weekly, mainly with the picky little details, but they're very doable if you attend quiz sections and glance through your book. The class is east to get a B in, but difficult to get an A in. Stuart is very clear in lectures and is a clever, entertaining speaker.",
      "Class was well structured and covered necessary material in a clear fashion. Class was enjoyable to attend.",
      "back to basics rocks.",
      "Especially good at explaining the homeworks, which is good because they are pretty hard. Very good at describing concepts, though I sometimes feel fuzzy on the details. Has an annoyingly good ear - he often shushes the class when the noise level is fairly quiet for a hall with 200+ people in it.",
      "Stuart is a wonderful. He already knows that ~10% of the class already knows the material, so he much of his time lecturing to us students who are new to this. It is apparent when he covers a new topic; rather than breezing through material in an hour, he usually spends an entire week to ensure that the class understands the underlying idea. &lt;3",
      "He is great at teaching the material...unfortunately that is not enough to get you through the class. The assignments are difficult as well as the exams. Help is very limited, since asking for help is generally discouraged (and depending on the type of help, prohibited) due to his strict policies. Lowest grade I've received in any course.",
      "great teacher, just look out for the TA's.",
      "His lectures were very informative and interesting. I never needed the book(in fact I didn't buy one). The homework assignments sometimes take a while, be prepared. For the midterm, time was the primary issue. The grading is a bit on the harsh side. Do as many of the practice exams as possible. Enjoyable class, great professor. Highly recommended.",
      "Great teacher, really knows his subject.",
      "Hard class, if you are new to Java programming this class is difficult. Stuart really knows what he teaches but he knows it too well that sometimes he leaves students behind while catering to students who can write code in their sleep. He didn't seem to mind that over 1/2 the class failed the midterm. Midterm is a killer, final is not too bad.",
      "hard",
      "An excellent teacher, at least for those with an interest in the field (and quite possibly for those without one; I couldn't say). Not only is he very interested in whether or not the students learn, but he's excellent at helping them to do so.",
      "Lectures are very interesting and well thought out, his advice and tips are great, homework is also interesting and fun. His midterms are difficult because of time mainly (beware). Reges really knows his stuff also. =) Overall, his class is pretty laid back and just fun!",
      "Awesome guy.",
      "Very clear, very fun, hard grader, VERY hard to get a great grade, but easy to get a &quot;pretty good&quot; grade. Many hate him, many like him. One thing's for sure, however.. He WILL keep your interest in class and I believe he has influenced a lot of people to become CSE majors. He needs to be more approachable outside of class, however.",
      "Good man",
      "Amazing lecturer. I'd recommend him in a heartbeat. I especially recommend his honors section, should he offer it-- its an entertaining group discussion on topics ranging from Qubic to the Halting problem to RSA Encryption. His lectures are entertaining, his assignments are presented well, though for help outside of class, TAs have more time.",
      "great instructor, lectures always entertaining",
      "Reges is one of the best lecturers out there. He can explain complex topics in such a way that they seem intuitive (and he uses liberal amounts of humor to lighten the mood). Unlike some others here, I found him to be easy to talk to outside of lecture, so long as you don't ask questions that are designed to agitate or second guess him.",
      "Absolutley rediculous. listen in class and it's easy. And his metaphors are hilarious, though not intended to be so.",
      "This class was frustratingly easy, because the teacher gave away all of the hard parts of the homework in class, stopping us from having to think about it ourselves. Since it was graded on a curve, this evened out the grade across the class and stopped the smarter students from coming to the top of the class. Good for people who get bad grades.",
      "This man is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best professors I've ever had! He had a good sense of humor and made learning fun. He had these analogies that made our assignments easier to approach. He is the man!!",
      "Knows the material very well, very interested and enthused about it. Very clear teacher. The class is not easy, but he is a very good professor.",
      "i &lt;3 the star trek jokes! :D",
      "Lots of Star Trek jokes. Funny guy, very smart and enthusiastic.",
      "If you have any prior CS knowledge, this prof will be extremely easy. He's very clear, though, and very knowledgable. Definately recommended",
      "Interesting to listen to and all in all a good teacher.",
      "One of the UW's best professors. He's taken a course (CSE 142) that is renowned as being difficult and turned it into an enjoyable class that anyone can take and do well in without killing themselves in the process. Students should fight to have him as a professor (rather than have someone else).",
      "He's a cool professor that would talk non-stop from the beginning to the end. His sense of humor keeps most of us up during the 9:30 am class. The lecture are mostly interesting and easily understood.",
      "Extremely engaging, always keeps the class interested. Explains material so well that a 4-year-old could understand it, but without dumbing it down. Best teacher I've had so far (in 2 years). Had him for CS 245 (Intro to Discrete Math) at U of Arizona.",
      "Hey is a really nice (from what I can tell) and funny guy. He is a real geek at heart and makes lots of references to Star Trek.",
      "He is extremely helpful and always excited to talk to students. At least this quarter the midterm and final are open book and open notes, and he does not make them extremely difficult. I personally have had no prior programming experience and am understanding what he is teaching.",
      "Professor Reges is new to UW as of this quarter (Autumn 04), but has been great so far. He is humorous, gives out some interesting homework problems, and I can tell he is quite good at communicating to non-technical people, much better than me for sure. His midterms can be tricky, watch out.",
      "He is supposed to be the reorginizer of intro cs classes and is doing a decent job in cse 142. I does not teach theory and vocab, just programming basics. Becuase of the wide range of experience of the people in the class, it is hard to say if it is easy or not. Just depends on the person."

I didn't go to many lectures, due to horrible sleep habits but the ones I did show up to were great. He takes time to get to know his students and make class interesting. If you take this class, GET KANTWON!!!!",
      "Kantwon is an amazing professor. For someone with little coding experience, this class was very challenging. Homework is very time consuming, but help desk is great. Work with others toward understanding. I did very poorly on the tests, but with final replacement, I was able to pull it up to a B. This is a very common experience. Don't lose hope.",
      "Definitely the best teacher I've had in my entire life. Not only is he a wonderful teacher, he's also a great person, and you can tell that he genuinely cares about you. He's inspired me to pick up a minor in CS, even though I had no programming experience before college. Make your schedule around this man's class because trust me, it's worth it.",
      "I attended Kantwon's lecture though I wasn't in his section. He is the best prof if you have no previous coding experience. Explains topics really well, focuses on the why behind each topic rather than just solutions to examples. This semester they stopped allowing students from other sections into his lecture and scan Buzzcards (due to fire code).",
      "Kantwon is great. While the class is considered to be one of the harder intro CS courses, if you practice the material it will come to you eventually. Don't wait until the last minute to do homework, because you never know when there will be that one problem that takes you forever to do. Go to recitation. The TA's are probably the best TAs at Tech.",
      "I wasn't even in his section but I went to his lectures and have 0 regrets. He's truly the best professor I've had at tech (and I didn't take this class as a freshman). It's a hard class mostly because of the homework, but the homework is really well done so if you feel good about it you are pretty set for the exams.",

      "Kantwon is a great lecturer, and so long as you do the homeworks and GO TO LECTURE. You'll be fine.",
      "He's a good teacher. This class is not nearly as difficult as people make it out to be. Just go to lecture, start the hws early, and do the hw by yourself so you understand it better.",
      "CS 1371 was my first experience with coding and Kantwon truly left a positive impression of programing. He is a funny lecturer and nows how effectively teach the course material. I'm so grateful for having him as my MATLAB lecturer and he is a true gem of Georgia Tech.",

      "I hate computer science. I'm only taking it because it's required for engineers. Kantwon makes me want to add a CS minor. He is fun, lovable, and genuinely cares about his students. He wants everyone to learn how to Matlab and he teaches it so that everyone can understand, even when coding is completely foreign to them. Amazing professor and person",
      "Best teacher I've had in my life. Go to lecture because Kantwon makes difficult concepts seem straightforward. If you pay attention in lecture you won't even need to show up to recitation.",
      "Literally the best teacher at Tech. Don't even think twice. Take his class. It will change you. Go to every lecture. His class will change your perception of everything. Words don't do justice for how amazing he is. You will not only understand coding but learn to love MATLAB.",
      "Very difficult class but he knows what he is doing, very on-point and makes class fun. Hws are very hard but TAs are super accessible and tests are pretty predictable if you go to every lecture. HE IS AMAZING, EVEN IF YOU NEVER HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS, STILL MEET HIM ONCE IN YOUR LIFE.",

Actually there is no word that'll give him justice for how good he does his job. I don't think you'll have a professor like him after you take his class. He taught me something I never thought id be able to do.",

This was my first class 3/5 days of the school week and I would always be so pumped to go to this class as soon as I woke up! You'll be blessed if you get to have him for CS 1371.",
      "Definitely a gem in the entire GATech community. He understands how to communicate CS to millennials. He's so good that the giant lecture hall is packed EVERY class. He also offers scholarships to the students in his section which is HIGHLY EXCEPTIONAL and shows how much he cares about us. The content is hard but he made it so easy to understand!",
      "cool guy, class is pretty hard. Matlab is the worst. But Kantwon really loves teaching and he loves his students. He makes the sucky class a little less sucky.",

He goes over very useful examples, and uses very helpful analogies to help you understand. Pay attention in class and do the HW in good faith and you will be fine. He really cares about all his students, so get to know him!",

His lectures often feature Kahoot quizzes; he makes a lot of jokes; he has a solid background in education research, and is passionate about teaching. He is very easily reachable, and even has dinner with students in dining halls sometimes. 5/5!",
      "Kantwon Rogers may well be the best educator I have ever had. I've had good professors for sure, but I feel like the students who aren't allowed the chance to be in his lectures really are missing something. Relatable, funny, and genuine person. He wants you to learn CS, and he wants you to have fun doing it. Couldn't ask for a better professor.",
      "Coming from a person who is totally not a morning person, his lectures are totally worth waking up early for. There is a lot of homework for the class though as with any CS1371 class, and it takes FOREVER to do. There's also a huge curve a sorts at the end of the semester.",
      "Believe the hype. Kantwon is genuinely the best. His passion for teaching radiates from every lecture, which you should always attend. The homework in 1371 is obnoxious/time-consuming, but Kantwon does his absolute best to help make it reasonable. His lectures are some of the best I've ever seen: he's incredibly innovative in the ways he teaches.",
      "Deserves all the hype he gets. Cares about his students and MATLAB and tries to make the course as bearable as he can. Homeworks will still be time-consuming, though. If you show up to class, set aside a day of the weekend for the homeworks, and study the provided practice tests, you'll do well. If you don't get him, attend his lectures anyway.",
      "Kantwon's love for MATLAB shines in each of his lectures. He genuinely cares about not only what he teaches, but also all of the students. He made an effort to include everyone in a lecture attended by 150+ students, and was entertaining yet clear about what he was teaching.",
      "Couldn't have asked for a better professor for 1371. Kantwon just has a way with teaching CS that makes easy and bearable. He is EXTREMELY accessible outside of class and cares deeply for every one of his students. He is a really funny guy and always keeps lectures interesting. Not worth skipping his lectures!!",
      "100% recommend if you were able to get the class. Do not skip any of the lectures, because it is a GREAT way to start your day off. Kantwon is funny, smart, and the kind of teacher you want for this course. His test averages are the highest among all sections, and he will give you plenty of hints about the material on the midterms!",
      "Kantwon is an incredible teacher. As someone who had 0 experience with coding he made the material very understandable. He's hilarious and caring, and really seems to consider student feedback. Would definitely recommend.",
      "Amazing lecturer. Never had an interest in CS (hated it, in fact), but Kantwon made it much more accessible and easy to understand. Made me consider a CS minor (but the homework in this class made me not make that decision). Overall, the class is tough, but Kantwon makes it pretty easy with his amazing, hilarious, and clear lectures.",
      "Kantwon keeps the class entertained and uses fun strategies to teach the class. For example, he let me pie him in the face to demonstrate a concept. He is the reason why I have decided to pursue a CS minor. Try to take his lecture, but be prepared because his class fills up very quick.",

His class was challenging, but I feel like I was able to get a lot out of it.",
      "Downing is a good professor who really knows the material he teaches. I did not love the cold calling or the disconnect between the projects and lectures, and I would also not recommend taking this class if you haven't done Java in a while. The course is overall very rewarding and the exams are not that bad.",
      "I think Downing's class is one of the more organized and interesting UT CS classes out there. His grading criteria is pretty clear, and the tests are doable, especially if you make sure to do his hackerrank exercises before them. He does do randomized cold calling, so maybe skip this class if you have anxiety about that.",
      "Great professor, well taught and very accessible for questions. If you put in the work you will do just fine and learn a whole lot. Cold calling can be intimidating but Downing walks you through whatever is happening well until you understand. Side note: taking alongside with OS is not recommended, I did it and survived but would not recommend.",
      "He's a good guy who does his best to design a course that will teach you or force you to learn about industry-relevant skills. He might come off as a little rude, but the fact that he gives extra credit, offers make-up exams, and delays deadlines if he feels it's appropriate shows that he cares about his students. Group projects are a lot of work.",
      "Overall I think SWE is a good class to take with Prof. Downing. The tests aren't too bad and you definitely are engaged throughout his lectures. The projects for this class are pretty intensive and it's crucial that you get a group that consists of members that all actively contribute.",
      "This was definitely the class I've learned the most in during my time at UT and the amount of work reflects that. There's a large disconnect between lecture and homework, so much of it is learning on your own and it gets difficult to juggle at times but would definitely still recommend. Many of these skills are very applicable to post-grad jobs.",
      "You learn a lot in his class but it is not a majority A elective. Except a B to be a possibility when joining his class.",
      "Prof Downing is a great lecturer and keeps you engaged by &quot;cold calling&quot;, so be prepared to answer his questions! The majority of the grade in this class is based on a group project, and I would say that grading is a little arbitrary, or requirements aren't specific enough at times. Furthermore, the tests are very hard to get partial credit on.",
      "He is a good professor and this is a great class. However, the project and lecture do not have a strong relation. So be prepared for the self-learning for different web development tools.",
      "Downing really knows his material and wants you to learn too! The class is pretty accessible, so if you have a question someone will answer it. I felt that projects, despite the claim that it was about a good website, just became fulfilling requirements. Tests were difficult and stressful.",
      "Overall makes class pretty interesting and requires you to pay attention because he cold calls. Laptops are not allowed and there are somewhat easy quizzes at the start of every class (though you get some drops). Projects are in groups of 5-6 and are pretty work intensive.",
      "Downing is really clear at what he taught. The project isn't hard, they require patience",
      "Downing is a great professor. Anyone who wants to go into industry should take this class. The projects expose you to many different software tools. The project specs were very unclear until the very end, making it difficult to get the projects done early. He cold-calls but helps you get to the answer. Main advice: GO TO CLASS!",
      "Just show up to class enough times to get those quizzes done. You should still not skip at all. Get started on the projects early. If you do that and do decent on the test, you'll be fine. You'll learn a lot of juicy Python.",
      "I'm not a fan of cold-calling at all. There is also occasionally conflicting information regarding project requirements, making the projects more difficult and stress-inducing than necessary. Useful course if you're planning on going into software dev.",
      "Great class! You work on a huge web app group project the whole semester, so make sure you get a good group with both frontend and backend experience. Downing is a really respected professor, I highly recommend taking him before you graduate! The lectures aren't bad and go by quickly. Lot's of work, but pretty fun and worth it!",
      "A really good class to get creative and devote time into. The requirements for group projects can be ambiguous but the projects are still graded fairly.",
      "The course involves a large, group-oriented project that is the majority of your grade. It will largely be worked on out of class and requires a lot of man-hours. However, the knowledge you build from this project and the structure of the class is useful as a computer science major as it is intentionally reminiscent of the industry environment.",
      "Downing is a well-respected lecturer at UT for good reason. He cares about the quality of his classes and forces you to sink or swim. SWE is a huge workload, but you end up learning a lot of skills in order to be successful. I would highly recommend organizing a group before taking the class, as the projects aren't manageable without a solid team.",
      "Huge disconnect between what is taught in class and what is expected to be done in the projects. However, the TA's help a lot. Tests are on HackerRank, so that can be stressful.",
      "My freshman year, I was told to take all the Downing classes that I could by multiple UTCS graduates that are now working in the tech industry. Now I understand why. OOP and SWE are challenging and fast paced, be sure to prepare for Hackerrank exams, but I feel as though it has prepared me for my first developer job after graduation.",
      "A good CS upper division. Definitely practice the HackerRanks before tests.",
      "There are daily attendance quizzes so definitely go to class. If you don't the exams will probably be rough. Overall the class is a pretty decent amount of work but also has a pretty decent amount of helpful information for anyone trying to become a pretty decent CS major. 8/10 Pretty decent.",
      "Glenn's a really good lecturer, but material covered in class doesn't relate to projects. He really tests your chops in Python, and not knowing Python is what made the difference between a B and an A for me. Projects were cool and I feel like I was forced to learn a lot on my own. I'm a slacker, but still would highly recommend.",
      "Hard class, lecture material doesn't line up with projects but is expected to be known for tests. However this is a very rewarding class and you will enjoy suffering.",
      "One of the few professors at UT that I can say changed my way of thinking and actually prepared me for the real world. His lectures are always engaging and he writes notes down for you so you can just pay attention to the material while you are in class and review the notes later. I didn't read the textbook much but for certain topics, it helps.",
      "Semester project can be really heavy if your group is not equally contributing.",
      "Downing is a very enthusiastic teacher. Attendance is mandatory, but several daily quizzes get dropped. I think the tests are hard, and the projects are time consuming. Overall, a great class.",
      "SWE is a fun class and lets you learn a lot about some different technologies out there. Downing is a good professor and I do not have any major complaints. He has daily quizzes but many of them are attendance and there are t a lot of drops. Overall I would say he is a top 5 professor I've had at UTCS.",
      "This is the most project intense class I have ever taken, but at the same time, this is the most rewarding class experience, in terms of giving you the knowledge of how real life project will be made. The lecture is disconnected from the projects, but professor Downing gave a great lecture with HackerRank exercise to do in class.",
      "Downing is a really great professor that really cares about how you do in the class and that you actually learn. The projects and their requirements can be a pain sometimes, but overall they teach you a lot about SWE work. The tests aren't difficult provided you go to class and actively participate in the hackerranks.",
      "Has to be one of the best lecturers I had. He cold calls you in class but he would make you feel like you could answer anything. His lectures are great. He explained every detail of the concept to make sure you understand. Don't recommend if you're already a web-dev pro.",
      "Really liked his enthusiasm and knowledge on c++ but I really disliked how one of your projects was assigned over Thanksgiving break, and we had to pair program for 75% of it. Besides that I really enjoyed the class and he is quite the humorous guy.",
      "He does a good job incorporating class participation via random cold calls. The lectures are great w/ notes provided at the end of each. Therefore, you may doze off if you rely only on the notes. When it comes to talking w/ him, he is kind and willing to give you some advice on the projects.",
      "Professor Downing has been one of my favorite professors so far. He is so passionate about everything he is teaching. He does cold calling to ensure participation in the class and because of that, I was engaged the entire hour! Definitely a good one!",
      "Professor Downing really cares about teaching his students. His is flexible and accommodating, but still will challenge you. This class gives out what you put in. Depending on how into it you are, you will learn a lot.",
      "Was a fun class with a lot of work. Prof. Downing knows his stuff and teaches it in a fairly engaging way.",
      "Great professor, really fun to talk to and super available and willing to help you succeed.",
      "Downing is an amazing lecturer, and SWE was just as much fun as OOP. I highly recommend that everyone take at least one of his classes.",
      "Make sure you find yourself a good group. The projects are too big to do them alone.",
      "Attendance is mandatory. There are reading materials, but honestly it's absolutely managable not to read a single assigned material and still get an A.",
      "The lectures are very in depth. Attendance quizzes are assigned every day so be sure to attend classes.",
      "Software Engineering was intense. It is very project heavy. Classes are mandatory. The quizzes were harder than in OOP. I thought this course was ok. Although I learned a lot, I would have preferred to have learned the material in class rather than on the fly for each project. The lectures were interesting, but sometimes not helpful for projects.",
      "Prof. Downing also teaches SWE; expect SWE things to filter in. Not a &quot;fun&quot; class IMO-- I wouldn't take unless it's a prereq, or you hate fun. Participation is important in this class; you can be dropped a letter grade for missing enough quizzes. Late policy for projects is gracious. Largely a C++ class (haha) at first but eventually becomes OOP.",
      "The class is fun and engaging, and downing is a very animated professor. There's daily pop quizzes but he drops the lowest few.",
      "Great professor and lecturer. There's pop quizzes every day and they can be kinda difficult. The quizzes are also all out of 5 points so if you miss 1 point then it's an automatic 80 for that quiz. They aren't worth a whole lot individually, but they add up over time.",
      "The professor gives a really amazing lecture that constantly keeps you engaged and makes you want to learn. There are group projects, web development done in various phases, that doesn't relate to the content of the lectures. The tests are straightforward if you understood the lectures.",
      "SWE is very similar to OOP: cold-calling, daily quizzes, an easy solo project, group projects. In SWE, you'll build a website with a group of 4 other people. It's fairly easy to get enough points for a B, but getting more than that requires much more effort. The lectures / tests / quizzes aren't related to the projects, so you still need to study.",
      "Focus on practical hands-on experience rather than theoretical design. The group project is a great opportunity to try out working as an engineer.",
      "Really loved this class! Clear he knows what he's talking about. He cold-calls during class, but didn't mind that really. Also very good at telling you your answer is wrong without making you feel stupid, then explains the correct answer to you and does a good job of making you feel involved in the process. One of my favorite classes this semester!",
      "Downing's class is well organized and structured, and his lectures are interesting and explain concepts fairly well. If you have anxiety like me, his Socratic method and blog posts, as well as the constant group work probably won't sit will with you. Otherwise I think his class is a good choice, and a great way to get introduced to OOP and C++.",
      "Downing's OOP is a well designed and executed class. He will not lecture in the traditional sense. He teaches in a Socratic seminar style where everyone participates. The quizzes at the beginning of the class are the only draw about the class. But they really are a necessary evil.",
      "Downing is an amazing lecturer. You learn a lot about the little details of everything, and he really makes sure you understand the reasoning behind certain features of object-oriented programming languages. Quizzes can be pretty tricky, but even those are designed to test very specific knowledge that is relevant to the things he talks about.",
      "Solid class with great lectures and a clear grading criteria. A lot of relevant material is covered that will help you in your CS career. To get an A just put in the effort and go through the motions and you should be fine (as long as you don't bomb too many quizzes).",
      "There are quizzes every day and he cold calls for attendance points, but it's a useful and interesting CS class to take. The projects aren't too bad.",
      "Great lecturer, very clear about the concepts he presents and is open to questions during class. However, as soon as he covers a concept he doesn't hit it again, so missing class might hurt. Past that, he's happy to talk to students during office hours and definitely helps. One quiz per class and grading is very clear but strict.",
      "lectures go in depth for a low-level understanding of c++ class is pretty straightforward - 5 projects with option of working with a partner for extra credit attendance quizzes can be pretty ruff exams are fair and on hackerrank very organized and structured class overall",
      "Downing is an amazing lecturer and he is always prepared for lecture each day. There are daily quizzes, which might be frustrating for some people, but for me, these quizzes helped ensure that I actually remembered key material from the previous day's lectures. The projects were pretty easy as far as computer science goes but still very helpful.",
      "I really enjoyed his class. Although it is really project heavy",
      "He's an amazing professor. I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot, especially a deep understanding of Python. It's not very hard, although you have to be constant since there are daily quizzes. The project is fun to do and you are pretty much free to use whatever you want to use. Make sure to pick a great team.",
      "A great professor. He makes clear points and strictly follows his own schedule, so you would not get lost in his lectures. The funny thing is that the lectures are not greatly related to your projects, you need to do your own research on various tools and platforms.",
      "Good Professors, most of the projects are interesting and not too challenging",
      "Dr. Downing's lectures are fantastic. They're clear and comprehensive. You'll learn a lot without getting lost in the details. He's definitely one of my favorite lecturers at UT",
      "An amazing lecturer and caring professor. He is clear, precise, and thorough. The course is more like two courses: in-class and projects are disparate. Quizzes are terrifying: every class day - on canvas. Exams can be tough but fair: on hackerrank. A is doable. Great class and you'll learn a ton especially if you know nothing about web development",
      "You will learn a lot.",
      "Prof. Downing constantly engages with the class to explain examples. The large group projects can be a pain, but they get easier around halfway through, and its a worthwhile learning experience.",
      "Really good professor. Teaches with the socratic method. I disliked the first project because it had to be done alone. I wish he would go over how to set up some of the required software (EG: Docker). Quizzes are horrible. Covers mainly python, but tests on JavaScript as well. Overall, a great lecturer. I just wish I could have taken in the fall.",
      "Great class. The most valuable thing you'll get out of this course is your group project (and it's a large part of your grade), so make sure you have a good group that's willing to meet a lot and works hard. Quizzes get tough and will grind down your grade. Meeting project deadlines is hard, especially in Phase II, so beware!",
      "Prof. Downing is a great teacher. I have learned a lot from his summer software engineering course. Tests were online through Hackerrank. There were Canvas quizzes every class, and lectures were very important to attend in order to get the most out of the course. There were one solo project and 4 group projects. Overall he is an excellent teacher.",
      "Best CS Professor I've had so far at UT. Super passionate about teaching, and you'll learn a lot about Python and Javascript from his lectures. Group project may seem daunting at first, but if you have a good group of motivated people(prior experience is a plus) then you'll do fine, and you'll also learn a lot about web dev..",
      "A project-based, somewhat work-heavy class. Lectures are very effective, a bit tiring. Overall a very good class.",
      "Professor Downing is one of the best professors I've had at the University. His lectures are engaging and his &quot;cold calling&quot; strategy ensures that we pay attention and know what's happening. The projects in this class also taught me a lot of necessary tools that are essential for working in tech.",
      "Professor Downing's lectures are very engaging, and the materials are well organized. Tests are fair, you can do well if you pay attention to lectures. However, beware that most of the projects in this class are group setting, and the difficulty is high if you don't have prior web development experience. So, group communication is very important.",
      "Professor Downing teaches in a way that makes it very easy to learn. He definitely prepares you for industry.",
      "Professor Downing gives entertaining and informative lectures on detailed aspects of many programming languages. The exams and quizzes are challenging but doable. I learned a lot about different languages and tools that are practical in industry.",
      "I have never learned more from a professor than from Downing. He makes you truly understand what is happening and prepares you for real world jobs.",
      "Downing's class is great. Just remember, every point counts towards your grade, and it's important to do well on quizzes, projects, and the first exam. You'll need it to buffer your last exam grade.",
      "Professor Downing is a fantastic lecturer, He does a really good job of keeping students engaged, and actually calls on students in class. The course is very group project heavy as far as time and work goes. All of the stuff in lecture will be on the exams but the majority will be spent working on the internet database project. It uses react warned",
      "OOP is formatted almost identically to SWE, but don't believe that they're the same class--OOP is much easier. After taking OOP I went from being anxious about C++ to writing it comfortably. Lectures are incredibly clear and engaging, projects are manageable (unlike SWE). The final exam is no joke, but doable if you've been doing well in the class.",
      "Downing is a great professor. He keeps the lectures engaging and interesting. You have to learn all the tools for the projects by yourself (a good experience to have). I've learned a lot out of the projects, plus I have one more thing to put on my resume. The exams are all coding and they are over the material covered in class (not projects).",
      "Truly an awesome professor. He cares about his students and the subject he's teaching. The class is basically teaching you everything you need to know about C++, one of the best classes I've taken. I've started doing interviews in C++ because he goes so in depth with C++ that it is now my favorite language.",
      "Downing has a very engaging, active lecturing style and is very knowledgeable about the C++ content covered in the course, making OOP, as a class, very enjoyable. As long as you go to class, actively review the notes that he posts on his website, and practice the in class exercises before the exams, you'll probably have a good experience.",
      "Great professor that cares about his students.",
      "Downing is a very good professor. His lectures were engaging and useful. I feel like I learned a lot of useful knowledge about C++ in this class. Not a difficult class as long as you attend lecture and do the projects.",
      "Absolutely wonderful professor. I love how he uses the Socratic method to teach and engages every single student in class. I learned a TON in this class and am ready for a Software Engineering career now!",
      "You will learn a lot in Professor Downing's class, but you will have to put in the work. For Software Engineering, there is a slight disconnect between the lectures and the tasks required to complete the projects, but there is plenty of help available. Lectures involve language-specific details and the project is to build a dynamic website.",
      "Professor Downing really cares that everyone is up to speed on the material. We have quizzes every day and he calls out people in class in order to answer questions. However, he never makes anyone feel stupid or anything. I enjoyed this class since Professor Downing goes really in depth with the material and keeps it interesting.",
      "The work really pushes you to learn new tools but the return on investment is huge. Downing is a great guy, he cares a lot about his students.",
      "Everything assigned in this class is for a reason. I really feel like I learned useful material to be applied after graduation.",
      "It's a modern C++ class. Dr. Downing is very knowledgeable in the subject matter and does a good of explaining the intricacies of the language. It's a worthwhile class if you are interested in how the choice of programming language affects the decisions we make in the object oriented design process.",
      "Professor Downing really makes his class very interactive and interesting. I think that his class is amazing but if you're not interested in learning C++, that's all this class is. Attendance quizzes at the beginning of each lecture to test your knowledge of the material - they weigh heavily on your grade. All of the exams are on Hackerrank.",
      "Lectures are really solid and past the intro week you really do learn a lot about C++. Classes are mandatory through attendance quizzes. He randomly calls on a people each lecture but I respect that he manages to enforce class participation without making anyone feel nervous or bad regardless of their answer. Projects and tests are standard.",
      "Super engaging, and the projects you work on really give you a sense of working as a team. Be prepared to dedicate long hours working on your site though.",
      "The main project for this class takes a ton of time. However it teaches you a ton of tools that people actually use and will be very helpful when applying to jobs. Don't take this class with other project heavy courses especially ones with group projects or you will struggle.",
      "Class was a lot of work. Be prepared to meet up with your group often and come to class to take the daily quizzes. The quizzes are tricky and the tests are all on hackerrank so you need to be very comfortable with hackerrank and all of the concepts on the review/all of the class hackerrank assignments in class. Be prepared to be cold called.",
      "Great lecturer. This class will prepare you extremely well for interviews and give you a strong understanding of at least one part of web development.",
      "Downing is a great lecturer, who can make normally mundane things actually pretty interesting. The course material is useful, though not the most enlightening being mostly a course on C++, but he makes it nonetheless worthwhile. For anyone looking to improve knowledge of OOP and learn C++, this class is highly recommended.",
      "Took his CS373 SWE class, but that wasn't an option listed for whatever reason. He's a very solid professor, but there are daily 5 minute quizzes that can be challenging. It's really important to pay attention in the entire class. Otherwise you'll likely miss something that will be on a quiz or built on during lecture.",
      "I found this class to be extremely satisfying, and I learned a lot. I loved the lectures, and the projects provided enough challenge to teach concepts without being impossible. Take this class if you want to become a better software developer. Take this class or CS373 (with Downing) before you graduate if you want to have an easy time finding a job",
      "Prof. Downing is great! Projects are intensive but useful. Lectures don't help too much with the projects, but he's up front about this from the beginning and they are key to passing the exams.",
      "Downing is a great professor. Every CS student should take at least one of his classes. I just took OOP, and I plan to take SWE next year. He randomly calls on people during class. Do not fear this. It's fine if you don't know something... he will explain it in detail. It keeps you paying attention. Don't skip class or you will fall behind.",
      "Knowledgeable, professional, and engaging. Interactive with the students. He will ask questions on a random students as he writes code. Group work on a web project and learning about python/SQL/javascript. You will learn a lot about coding practices. Daily quizzes can be hard. Tests are fairly easy. Weekly blogs.",
      "I didn't read the textbook much, but I usually liked the articles he provided. It isn't difficult to get points for doing relatively minor tasks like attending class, working with a partner, and writing a weekly blog post. You will get called on frequently in class, but he'll lead you to the answer without making you feel bad about it.",
      "Downing is probably one of my most favorite professors. Although I've already done most of the stuff in the iDB project, I felt like I learned a lot just by being in class. Would highly recommend. He's a really passionate, caring professor, and anyone who takes him is beyond fortunate.",
      "Awesome class to prepare for interviews and internships. Downing is amazingly organized; lectures are routine and well prepared. He is also exceptional at explaining CS concepts and makes it easy to grasp. But definitely be prepared to work.",
      "Dr. Downing loves teaching this class. He always has a quiz for the first 5 minutes of the lecture, the quiz pertains to the last lecture, the readings, or just an attendance quiz. Beware of the cold calls during lecture, he calls on people randomly to answer a series of questions.",
      "Prof Downing is a great lecturer. The cold-calling is unfamiliar at first but keeps your attention in check. Definitely learned a lot in this course",
      "Professor Downing is great and his class is one of the most useful classes in the CS department! Everything we learn is practical and can be translated to an internship/job. The project uses tools that are well known. I think this class is a great way to get ready for an internship/job especially if you haven't done one before.",
      "Downing is one of the best CS professors at UT. You have to take at least one of his classes before graduating. He explains things clearly and makes sure to involve every student in the discussion.",
      "I think every CS student should take Downing's SWE class if they want to become a software engineer one day. You learn really useful skills and get the opportunity to work in a team. Also a great class if you want to learn Python in-depth. Definitely time consuming and challenging though.",
      "Great class, you learn about a lot of different web tools and frameworks, as well as Python, Javascript, and SQL. There are quizzes in every lecture, and these add up, so review the notes. Tests are hard but manageable if you study. The semester-long project requires a decent amount of effort, so make sure you have a good group.",
      "Professor Glenn Downing is overall a nice person and a great lecturer. The group project about developing a database website is real world, fun to work on, and rewarding in terms of self-education and worthy of showing a future employer. The tests are quite difficult and are very unforgiving if you mess up. Redemption from a mistake is difficult!",
      "I enjoyed Professor Downing's Software Engineering course thoroughly. I personally think this is as close as it gets to getting a feel for the industry process/standard of software engineering. Downing's lectures are clear and to-the-point, and his cold calls are nothing to be afraid of. Everything discussed is practical and easy to understand.",
      "The Software Engineering course he teaches is great and definitely worth taking! I would recommend taking it with people you know because most of the projects are group projects and you want a good group. Class engagement is a must because he randomly calls on students to answer questions, but walks you through it if you don't know it.",
      "His lectures are engaging. He is kind with his students when he teaches, and doesn't give off a &quot;I'm the professor and you're the student so I'm superior&quot; vibe. We used a lot of different frameworks and stacks in our projects, and I learned some of the complexities of Python, JavaScript, and SQL.",
      "Prof. Downing's lectures are incredibly helpful and provide tons of clarification for the topics he covers. The first few projects are great for getting accustomed to the way he wants you to set up the projects and beginning to use C++. The later projects (looking at you, Darwin/Life) definitely pick up on difficulty but it's definitely doable!",
      "Honestly this was one of the best, if not the best class I've taken at UT! I'd definitely take another class with Prof. Downing. The class was very well organized and defined. It was excellent!",
      "Great Lecturer, he calls on students randomly to answer questions so you always have to be ready to answer. The projects are very consistent with the coursework but the readings are not.",
      "Definitely a good lecturer, prof Downing tries his best to make sure everyone follows whatever he is teaching. He teaches very practical and useful C++ stuff. Attend lecture, do the projects with a partner, reading assignments don't seem that important.",
      "Great lectures and fair projects. Watch out the coding exams.",
      "He is a great lecturer, his socratic method engages students in lecture. Daily quizzes are really hard some times but he only counts 30 out of 43 (including extra credit quizzes and attendance quizzes every now and then). He offers extra credit if you work with a partner for each assignment (except for the first one). Tests can be hard though.",
      "There are quizzes every class, so you shouldn't skip lecture. I didn't like how he would randomly call on people in class. Material covered in lectures wasn't really related to the group projects. You still learn a lot overall from doing the projects.",
      "OOP was a great class to learn about C++. You really become familiar with the many gotchas of the language as well as differences between it and Java. Quizzes can be tough, but he drops many quizzes at the end. Just make sure to show up on time each class.",
      "Professor Downing's lectures are very engaging and worthwhile. If you do take the class, make sure to get there on time because he has a quiz at the beginning of each class!",
      "Good course to take. A lot of work to do in this course. The difficulties somehow depend on how hard your groupmates work.",
      "Professor Downing is an amazing lecturer. He constantly keeps the class engaged. You learn everything you'll need to know about C++ in a great environment. The projects are not too difficult. The quizzes can be very hard but aren't worth too much. Tests are manageable; they used to be much more difficult but have been made more reasonable.",
      "Solid prof. Python and SQL sections were very useful, refactoring not-so-much. I wish refactoring could be replaced with learning React in class. Assignments were fair and I learned a lot. However it takes forever to get grades back. Tools covered were very useful but too many pointless things like creating GH issues. Hit character count.",
      "There is a gap between lectures and projects that you will need to learn on your own. If that's fine with you, then you will like this class.",
      "I disliked how divorced the lectures were from the projects. It seemed like the lectures were simply there so that the course could be called a class, and the direction of the class was not clear. I would have appreciated the lectures more if they had been focused on practical, project-related topics (ex. user stories, fundamental tools, etc.).",
      "The best lecture I ever have. The quiz is giving to make sure you have understood the materials before the next lecture. The note is giving after class and detail enough. He makes each class so interactive and inspires students by asking some questions during each class. He pours full of his energy and passion in his class. I highly recommend him.",
      "Professor Downing is a great lecturer, very organized and always has a purpose behind what he requires of his students. I would be mindful of what other classes you take along with this one. I felt the class was overall fair, but it takes a lot of your time and Downing will make you work for a good grade. I felt I learned a lot from the class.",
      "Prof. Downing's lectures are definitely the highlight of the class. I always learned something new and interesting from them. The quizzes and tests can be tricky, but there are plenty of freebies and extra-credit opportunities for quizzes to make up for it. The main group project is a full-stack website which you'll have to work pretty hard for.",
      "Professor Downing is an amazing lecturer, definitely a class worth taking. You learn the intricacies of Python and some SQL, and the project for the whole semester is building a website with a group. The quizzes are hard, so definitely try not to skip class. Grading is fair. The class is a lot of work, but it is 100% worth it.",
      "One of the best professors at UT. Definitely one of the 'must take' optional courses",
      "Downing is a great professor! His lectures are quite interesting and you want to make sure you pay attention because that is what most of the quizzes and test questions are going to be over. You will also build your own website as a group project. This class requires a lot of effort, but is definitely worth it.",
      "Downing's classes aren't easy. You need to put the work in, but they are definitely a worthwhile learning experience. I highly recommend taking his classes while you can!",
      "Excellent course and easily one of the best professors I have taken in the CS department. I wish I could provide some sort of criticism, but it is hard to find any. The level of professionalism found throughout this course is a blessing.",
      "He calls on people all the time, but you get used to it",
      "Great professor. He really tries to make his class the best it can possibly be. Read, show up to class, start the projects on time, and everything will be ok. Nothing about this class is there to &quot;get you&quot; or lead you into a mistake.",
      "Really fun class that I learned a lot about during the projects. We had to use a variety of different tools to help us that I didn't know about beforehand which was really interesting. There's also a huge disconnect between the projects and the coursework so be prepared to take the initiative on your own to learn about the tools.",
      "Professor Downing definitely knows his stuff. I learned a great deal in this course, and I would recommend this class to any Computer Science student. There are 5 projects, and at the start of class there are daily quizzes. However, he gives you all the tools you need to be successful in the class.",
      "Reading is due every week, quizzes every class, and he calls on people in class, although if you don't know the answer, he's nice about it. The group project is very time consuming. He's a good lecturer and is good at explaining the confusing parts of the material.",
      "Downing is great at lecturing and you will learn a lot about C++. You also learn a lot about industry tools and it is generally just a good class to take. You don't learn much OOP, although we are taught many OOP concepts already in our intro courses at UT.",
      "Really amazing class to take. Quizzes every lecture about readings and previous lectures, so skipping is not an option. Cold calls on people every lecture, something I didn't like but got used to. He really knows his stuff. Overall, I enjoyed his class and would take him again, even if that means I'll be cold called again.",
      "The lecture is pretty good; the material is extremely useful for interviewing/software engineering jobs. Staying on top of the quizzes can be difficult if you want to receive an A because, despite the drops, he has a limited window for A's. Also, you *have* you make sure you're on a good team because he won't help you much if you have a deadweights",
      "I really enjoyed Downing's class it was super interesting and the projects were pretty informative imo. The first project was a bit tough but the semester long one was cool. Make sure you read and stay on top of it with the quizzes but if you work hard you'll be golden",
      "Passionate professor who seeks to prepare his students for industry. Has a very unique, methodical and logical lecture style that helps to introduce and reinforce concepts. His classes (CS371p and CS373) have heavy workloads and are group-based, so make sure you make time for them and START EARLY ON THE PROJECTS. Overall, learned a lot.",
      "Taking a Glenn Downing course is something that every UTCS major that is interested in getting into the software engineering field must do. In class you learn about python, OOP principles, SQL, and java. The large group project (IDB) is all web development to be done in python Flask for the back end and Javascript React for the front end.",
      "I give Prof. Downing a 5-star. He gives out all his passion for making sure everyone in the class to get as much as he/she can in every single class he teaches. He is one of the kinds that he has solid knowledge of the domain he teaches and full of experience on how to convey it to you. You will love his classes and I highly recommend him to you.",
      "Great professor with a clear interest in the subject material. Not too sure why we had the textbook though because although it was assigned reading, it never came up in anything. Best CS professor I've had yet at UT",
      "Great guy, super helpful when you have a question and willing to listen to make sure he understands where your understanding might be flawed. 10/10 best professor at UT",
      "Excellent course. Group projects are crazy hard, but very good for learning. You get out what you put into it, and you have a lot of freedom.",
      "Good balance between a self-taught group project for the duration of the class, with lectures on a variety of tools and languages. I would have preferred a bit of the reverse, with instruction focusing more on proper software engineering practices, and on how to use the tools required for our projects, but it was a good class overall.",
      "The class is primarily a means of building a full web app with your group. If you want to learn React, SQL, Python, and Flask (and have the time to build out the entire stack) this class is for you.",
      "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning the details of how C++ works and find reasons why it's usually better than Java. I feel that we didn't learn much about OOP fundamentals, but I do feel much more confident when I write code in C++ after taking this class. Dr. Downing is extremely knowledgeable and very helpfu",
      "This is my second time taking Downing's class. Once for OOP and another for SWE (current class). Overall, Downing is a fantastic professor that really loves teaching and staying current on new technologies that appear in the field. For job preparation, Downing is a must.",
      "This is probably the best professor and class I've taken at UT. The group project was incredibly relevant to working in the industry today. Graduating with a degree in CS from UT without taking this course would be a mistake.",
      "I took OOP class, and it was great! He cares the future recruiter expectations which mean all course material and tools we use are really practical. The projects were done by two except the first one. I learned the importance and advantages of team projects.",
      "The projects require the use of many tools; if you've had an internship then you'll fare better in this class. The tests and quizzes have very specific questions so be aware of what concepts are stressed in class and on the quizzes. Find a good team and you'll be fine.",
      "Class was work intensive, mostly working on the projects. Projects are very useful and you make something you can showcase. Enjoyed working as part of a team, happy with the product.",
      "A great class to take for those wanting to enter the software developing field.",
      "Quizzes are rough but there is extra credit quizzes to help offset that.",
      "Great lecturer, he's well-prepared and posts class notes and examples online. I've gained a solid understanding of the languages and concepts he teaches in class because his examples are clear and he gets right to the point. He gives a quiz at the beginning of each lecture and you have to be in class to get the code to unlock it.",
      "Professor Downing is hands down one of the best professors at UT. However, he'll make you work for your grade. If you're really good at tricky multiple choice tests, you'll probably do fine. For SWE, be prepared to work with a group in many different disciplines. Web development is not particularly easy, especially in a class setting.",
      "Dr. Downing is a great professor. He is very knowledgeable about the material and is very thorough during his lectures, providing detailed explanations for everything he says. The projects can be difficult, but you learn a lot doing them and they aren't as time consuming as other CS classes. There are also daily quizzes, so you need to go to class.",
      "I'd suggest taking this class if you haven't had your first internship or are particularly interested in web dev. Otherwise materials are similar to what you have at a job. Pick your groups very carefully. This is not as hard as OS but it may take as much time if you want to build a great product. This is NOT a class to take off your startup idea.",
      "Downing is a great professor. He's passionate about what he's teaching and is clear with the way the course is organized. There are daily quizzes and a group project for the whole semester. Pay attention during lectures, he cold-calls people.",
      "Downing is a wonderful professor. Knows what he is talking about and is very organized with the way he structures the course. There are daily quizzes and a group project for the course",
      "Take Downing during your time at UT if possible. He is such a great lecturer, and an insanely smart professor.",
      "I highly recommend you take a course by Glenn Downing before graduating from UTCS While there are some downsides to his courses (quizzes every class, difficult projects), the lectures and exposure to new tools and modern workflows is worth it. Downing cares about his students and wants everyone to learn and be successful.",
      "A great professor -- he is very organized, and his lectures are clear and concise. He provides notes from each lecture and is quick to respond to any questions from students. The course is a bit time-consuming -- it involves daily quizzes over lectures/readings, active participation during class, 2 exams, and several 5-6 person group projects.",
      "Quizzes at the start of each class. They can be tricky, but he drops a few, and offers bonus quizzes if you go to certain events. Good lecturer.",
      "Good professor, he gives quizzes at the beginning of the class so if you are not on time you will miss the quiz. He also calls people to answer his questions rather than lecturing alone.",
      "Great professor. He provides a lot of useful resources that are very helpful in preparing for a job/internship. The daily quizzes can be a little challenging but the exams closely follow the format of the quizzes so they're pretty useful. As long as you go to class and pay attention, you should be fine. The projects are a bit time consuming.",
      "You will learn a lot in this course if you take an active roll. Be sure to actually study for the daily quizzes. The content in lecture is pretty dissociated from the project. Lectures are pretty dry, but he keeps you engaged by cold-calling, which kept me from zoning out. The project was rewarding given that you have a product at the end of it.",
      "Downing is an awesome lecturer, but he is a brutal grader. I love taking his classes because I enjoy the way he teaches, but that often won't translate to your grade. Think long and hard about what you want out this class. If you want a good grade, probably best to pass, but if you want a valuable experience, give it a shot.",
      "This class is super useful for learning development techniques and tools, but doesn't do much in the way of teaching you how to be a 'good' web developer. You're always working against a deadline, and on top of the stress, the lectures are more in line with OOD, not full-stack dev. Expect to learn most everything your grades depend on yourself.",
      "I have had the great opportunity to take 2 classes with Prof. Downing. He really focuses on very practical information along with good theory and design practice. His lectures are very entertaining and I enjoy his Moore Method of explaining topics. My only gripe is the reading, it seems useful, but I never read them until test time.",
      "Group projects due every 2 weeks. Each project was built on top of the other and the final product was a dynamic website. Quizzes every day in the first 5 minutes of class.",
      "A few important points - attendance is required, the course requires significant mental energy, and it will be time consuming. It should not be difficult to get a good grade if you are engaged with the class, but for more independent learners and those that do not do well with strict organization and oversight this may not work out well for you.",
      "One of the best professors at UT. All of this professor's courses are worth taking and you will come out knowing so much more about the subject. Would highly recommend.",
      "Excellent lectures with student participation. Cadence and diction are a cross between Penn Jillette and Wallace Shawn's Vizzini. Requires laptop for tests, which has coding via HackerRank. Textbook not used. Daily quizzes. Projects straightforward with clear grading criteria. Introduces many useful tools for software design. Take his course!",
      "Professor Downing gave out his best experience and knowledge to this class. He put his full enthusiasm in each lecture. One of the many best things was he made the class so interactive and vivid. I love this class and love to have other classes from him in the future.",
      "Awesome class, went from knowing nothing about C++ to making it my language of choice. You definitely need to go to class, and the final is significantly harder than the midterm. Just study, go over the quizzes, go to class, ask questions. Hugely rewarding class.",
      "Staying attentive in class is the best preparation for the quizzes, and the quizzes are essential in preparing for the tests.",
      "Prof. Downing is an excellent lecturer. I guarantee you'll learn a lot. The workload is high, so you'll most likely end up working nights and weekends to finish his projects, but you do get a partner, which helps. I had a lot of trouble with the tests and quizzes, which is unusual for me. There is lots of extra credit, though, so it evens out.",
      "I took this class as my last class at UT. I had previously had 4 software engineering internships and I can say that this class more closely resembles what software engineering is like in the real world than any other class I took. It has an extremely high workload, so I don't recommend taking it with other difficult CS classes.",
      "Great lecturer and you learn quite a lot in the class. Some of those things aren't taught directly by him, though that's kind of the point. I feel like I would have liked this class a lot more had I not taken it over the summer. Don't go in with expectations because it appears that a lot of class's rules/guidelines are subject to change.",
      "I am definitely glad I took his class. I learned a lot. It was a lot of work.",
      "A very good C++ course",
      "A very good course if you want to learn Python and web development.",
      "Downing is a great teacher. He really makes you work especially during the summer course but its a great experience and you will learn alot. If you're seeking a future in web development I highly recommend taking this course!",
      "Take the class if you are new to web development. If you put in the effort, you will be able to learn a lot about the front end, the back end and how every fits together in the \"story\" that he talks about so much. (P.S. All textbooks able to be found online if you are a broke college student)",
      "Pretty tough course, but you will walk out of this class with a much better grasp of software fundamentals. He is a solid lecturer, he will call directly on you in class and ask you questions about the current topic in a conversational manner. The projects take a LOT of time, especially if you have no background in web development, so start early!",
      "Generic Programming with Prof. Downing has been one of my favorite classes I've taken at UT. Prof. Downing is VERY precise with the word choice describing C++ constructs and he teaches by having conversations with students about code examples. If you want to become a better programmer, take one of his classes before you graduate.",
      "CS 371G Generic Programming is only offered during the summers as a 9 week course, and I would definitely recommend it. This was my first Downing class and I was a bit skeptical, but it was great. From what I can tell, a lot of the projects are the same as some of the OOP projects, so If you have already taken that you have an easy leg up.",
      "Amazing teacher. Quizzes are deadly though. Right at the beginning of class, timed, tricky, and worth 18% of your final grade. Highly recommend taking him though, but don't expect to get an A",
      "Downing is a respected professor. He conveys information clearly and requires daily participation from students. Quick to respond to messages. CS373 taken over the summer was difficult at points. Quizzes are daily and require preparation. Tests require review of every detail of notes, even the seemingly small ones. Projects are time-consuming.",
      "The class is very intensive over the Summer, with constant reviewing of material required if you want a good grade. The group projects depends heavily on the hours you put in, and the effort of your group members. There are daily quizzes which cover material from the previous class, so it is important not to get behind with the lectures.",
      "Engaging lectures Randomly calls on students for lectures, but will walk you through problems if you don't know the answer. Difficult quizzes, but had a few extra credit opportunities (4% points). Tests are pretty easy if you have a good grasp of the material.",
      "Very incisive lectures. Professor Downing elucidates every new concept, and he does his best to make sure no one is left behind. He also is keen on his students getting experience with methodologies and tools used in industry.",
      "Downing makes everything in this class 'crystal-clear', from concepts taught to project requirements. I can honestly say that I enjoyed my time in his class.",
      "Great teacher. The way he teaches CS is different from most professors because demonstrates everything with code and involves students in the lecture. Also, I found learning C++ very valuable.",
      "Take Prof. Downing if you can. His lectures are a great introduction to C++ and is very valuable if you haven't used C++ before. The class allows you to see the differences between Java and C++ and a very thorough explanation on those differences. One of the better CS courses IMO.",
      "A very excellent professor with a great personality and humor. Great at teaching beyond the basics but not going way too far from there. Introduces relevant material and content from industry. As long as you attend class (and read quiz questions carefully), your grade will turn out great. Highly recommend taking for the knowledge and professor.",
      "Downing requires attendance and has daily quizzes, of which he drops 6. Classes are decently entertaining, but can be a bit slow. Extra credit for working in groups on the projects. Tests are extremely detailed and specific.",
      "Definitely one of the best professors at UT. The class isn't very hard as long as you attend all the lectures (which is required anyways, as there is an in-class quiz just about every day)",
      "Professor Downing is an incredibly lecturer and has refined the courses he teaches down to an exact science. You will learn a ton from him and be pushed to learn even more outside of the classroom. Professor Downing is difficult but always fair, and the amount you gain from being part of his class is well worth it.",
      "This is one of the best courses I've taken at UT, and I wish I could take it again. Professor Downing is a great lecturer and although the class is tough, I highly recommend taking it.",
      "Great professor, keeps lectures interesting and makes students stay alert in class by calling on random students to ask questions. Provides lot of information and advice that helps with getting internships and learning about the tech culture.",
      "Downing is arguably one of the best professors in the CS department. It's a very intense class, but you'll enjoy it. He's the only professor who I would get a C from and come back to take a second class.",
      "Probably the best lecturer I've ever had. But his exams were bad, and he didn't give us enough time to finish them. Hard quizzes in every class that cover your comprehension of material thoroughly. Projects take 10-20 hours each, but he gives extra credit for working with partners. Solid professor, but held back by his awful exams.",
      "He knows how to keep a class engaged - lectures are generally worth going to. He also calls on people to ask technical questions, but is chill about it.",
      "Loved the class. Downing is a great lecturer and I enjoyed most of the projects. Two tests, no final. If you score really well on the projects you can still pass even if you do very poorly on the tests. Second test was way harder than the first. Be prepared to have a daily quiz. They start off easy then get really tough.",
      "Really amazing lecturer. So far I can tell the only person who can \"compete\" with him in terms of programming skills is Mike Scott. Quizzes everyday and be prepared to get called in class. Projects aren't too bad but you need to start early; the tests are hard given that you only have a short amount of time to finish them.",
      "Downing has one of the most well structured, engaging, influential teaching styles in all of UT. You are required to come to class on time for mandatory quizzes. He will call on random students during class to bring the entire room in with the lesson. Come to class and be willing to learn C++ and you'll make an A.",
      "Software Engineering with Downing is a great class where you will learn concepts actually applicable to the real world. There are daily quizzes, participation, 2 individual/partner projects, a group project consisting of 3 phases, and 2 tests. Though he may seem intimidating, Downing is actually very understanding and wants students to succeed.",
      "Glenn Downing's OOP class is incredible. If you're looking for good structure in your learning, pick Downing.",
      "He is, hands down, the best professor I've had at UT (and he has some tough competition). His lectures are funny and engaging, his objectives are clear, and his projects have just the right level of length and complexity. The knowledge and inspiration I gained from this course will likely stay with me for years to come."

Projects are incredibly time-consuming, but really satisfying when you finish and cover a lot of different things that are industry-applicable. If you have room in your schedule, definitely take his course!",
      "This is a great class and a must have for anyone looking for a job in web tech. I wish there was more time to finish the last project. I spent long nights :-( but on the other hand I learned a lot. You need to be a google search master as you will need it. Highly recommended.",
      "Prof. Papa is tre be prof and CS dept. very useful material to get a job in web tech. I was hired by Amazon just on my projects in this class. A former student on the class was my interviewer. Thanks prof Papa.",
      "This class is amazing. Do not believe the bad reviews, They are from students that likely scored badly in the exams an exercises. This class is TOUGH! The exercises are TOUGH. This class is not for you unless you want to spend LOTS of hours at the end of the course. For me, I was able to use homework 8 in my portfolio to get an internship.",
      "I agree with the comment &quot;Be ready to self-study. The assignments requires HARD WORK.&quot; It is totally true, BUT what you get out of the assignment is ready material for your portfolio to show recruiters and for internships interviews. I just showed my project and got the internship with barely extra effort. Can't say that for any other CS course.",
      "Be ready to self-study. The assignments requires HARD WORK.",
      "Prof. Papa is the best way to get jobs in webtech at USC. Period. This class is really the only avenue for that for both Internships and PERM jobs. I got my summer internship because of the CSCI571 projects and I have not even finished the course. Must take course.",
      "Heading towards the end of our course. I would like to thank Papa for the tremendous knowledge he helped me gain with CSCI 571. It helped me bag an internship with amazing pay and perks in Bay Area. Yes, the homeworks are heavy and it can be frustrating when you have assignments of multiple subjects piled up, but I guess it is worth our efforts.",
      "This class is awesome! Prof. Papa is very inspirational. One of the best CA classes at USC.",
      "Prof. Papa manages a hard class. That is why some people find it too difficult and complain. BUT I got an internship at Google's YouTube just because of what Prof. Papa taught me. If you want a job in Webtech, this si the class to take. Highly recommended.",
      "Just landed an internship at Quora. All because of this class. The last 2 homework exercises were really tough and time consuming, but I learned so much that the interviews in webtech were just a piece of cake. Do not take this class if you are not ready to spend long nights the last 4 weeks of the course. You've been warned. Best Prof. at USC.",
      "Great lecture and material, but be warned. The last two exercises are MASSIVE in terms of amount of time needed. I spent weeks of night programming to get then done. But the tradeoff, I gained huge knowledge. A hard class but very valuable for all web tech aficionados.",
      "Great class material. Prof has lots of industry experience. Love the stuff about React, Firebase and TOR. Highly recommended for anyone interested in Webtech.",
      "Prof. Papa is teaching one of the best classes at USC. And now that he only teaches one section, it is very tough to get in. The reason is that students that take this class have an easier time finding jobs in Webtech. I just landed a position at Amazon, and all because of this class. Thanks Prof. Papa. This is a must class for anyone in CS.",
      "Best class I took at USC for my next job: webtech. Prof. is really good an industry-savvy. Helps a lot with internship applications. BUT, this class is tough. Lots of homework, long nights. But is was all worth it.",
      "This is not an easy class. I understand a few student got F for collaborating because of the amount of time needed for the exercises. I personally think it is true. BUT, the results for me are amazing. Got through my internships interviews incredibly well, all because of the material I learned here. Prof. Papa is helping students. And he is funny!",
      "One of the best courses in the CS dept, and the only one that covers in depth Webtech. Don't get me wrong, this is a tough course, and the competition for good grades is fierce with 400+ students, but the material is awesome and prof Papa is a great presenter. It shows that he is an expert in the subject. Highly recommended to s/w developers.",
      "Hot class! Great material! Fabulous prof. 'Nuff said!",
      "Super important material for jobs in Web tech. Great prof. super accessible on Piazza. a must class for any CS Master graduate.",
      "Fabulous course and professor. Already used material for getting an internship. Prof has huge industry background. A must for cs students interested in webtech.",
      "This class is tough, but awesome for anyone in Webtech. Everything included: HTML5, CSS3, lots of JavaScript, NodeJS, Bootstrap, React, Firebase, AWS and Google cloud, ioS and Android client dev. The homeworks are very difficult and take lots of work, BUT there is no other course at USC better than this on WebTech. The prof is amazing!",
      "Lots of difficult but inspiring homework. A must if you want to get a job in WebTech. Prof. Papa is as good as it gets. Highly recommended for client and server webtech.",
      "Just to reiterate I think this is the best course I am taking at USC. The material is going to be a huge help in finding a job in Webtech. I'm looking forward to lectures on serverless, microservices, AWS Lambda, React and Firebase. Prof. Papa is always very prepared and a huge help on Piazza. He is a great instructor. Funny, too.",
      "CSCI571 is really awesome! I got to learn much in this class, the professor is caring, producers are really knowledgeable, I am an EE student but I learned about about web technologies. The HWs are really amazing, MAKE SURE TO DO THE HW ASAP., though the graders are not so mean about grades.",
      "Wow, this class was awesome! But it was very hard. Just finished the last mobile project. Got 10/10 but it cost me two weeks of late nights. The class material is very good. Prof. Papa is very inspiring and shows you the latest wbtech. I was able to see going to the Dark Web. For anyone interested in webtech this course is must. Its worth it.",
      "I am almost done with the Fall semester of CSCI6571 and this class is awesome, but very, very heavy on homeworks, that get progressively more difficult and time consuming. But it is all for good as you will get some fabulous material. We just covered, AWS and GCP cloud, plus serverless AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions. Fascinating!",
      "Great home works on Wb App and mobile app. Super fast responses on Piazza. Loved the server less like AWSLambda. Prof told half the students get A or A minus. I did. LOL.",
      "Great class. Great Prof. Worth the LOTS of money I paid for it (4 units at USC are expensive).",
      "This class got me an internship at Amazon! I had everything to nail the interview: nodejs, pHP, angular and most of all AWS. the prof. Is always online day and night on Piazza. My doubt were solved in minutes. The exercises are HARD. Don't take this class if you do not have time. I spent many nights working on the web app and mobile app. Take this.",
      "Great course.",
      "It was a different experience and I got to learn a lot",
      "Great Prof. I'm glad I have only a final. The final projects were HARD! Good solving my doubts on Piazza. Prof. helped finding internship in web tech. Recommended.",
      "Very Professional and curt, but has a good sense of humor once you get to know him. Good knowledge and is a SME in the field. Tough yet challenging assignments, makes you work hard even through exams. But you will come out of class with a lot of skills and learning!",
      "Prof. Papa's CS571 is easily one of the best courses for Computer Science Master's Student out there at USC. Assignments will really help you get your feet wet in all the current web technologies. You will have to really work hard for your grades but it's worth it at the end of the day! Recommend this class to anyone planning on MS in CS at USC.",
      "Professor Papa is really good. He kept the materials up-to-date and illustrated each topic very clearly. The homework is not so difficult. Finishing them independently will give you solid foundation of web technology.",
      "Lots of learning. You will not regret taking this course. The assignments are designed to get your hands on a lot of concepts which are currently being used in industry which ultimately adds a lot of value to resume.",
      "He is very good",
      "Course is harder than I thought. Prof has lots of industry experience. Piazza is used 100% for solving my doubts. Glad Papa is flexible to change and dump the videos (really boring) and replace with hands-on demos. Exams require some memorization and lots of JavaScript knowledge. But I am glad I took it. Requirement for CSCI572.",
      "Prof. is good. Listens to students: dropped the crappy videos and started doing demos, which solved all my s/w installation doubts. would recommend. It's hard, though.",
      "Prof. Papa is a bit rough at times, but the material is very topical. I just went through \"serverless architectures\" like AWS Lambda and Google Functions and I knew that will help me get an internship at Amazon this summer. Exams are a bit rough with a lot of code, but the exercises are the bulk of the grade. Papa solved all my doubts on Piazza.",
      "One month to go in this course, and I am glad I signed up. Great material. I disliked the slides, though. I am glad Prof. Papa switched to hands-on demos. Much better. Also glad no more switching on spec online. Glad the prof is listening to students complaints. That's refreshing. I will take CSCI572, as definitely I have all needed background.",
      "Prof. Papa provides great new material. Just saw stuff on AWS Lambda and Google Functions, the server less stuff. It is going to help together me a job in web tech easier. Prof. is online on Piazza at all hours, day and night. Weird but great. I recommend for everyone interested in web tech. The class is not easy, though.",
      "Prof. Papa is very knowledgeable about Webtech and resolves all my doubts on Piazza or in class. I am at middle of the course, I would take it for sure, I recommend.",
      "This class was not easy. Professor Papa is a great Prof. Responds to all doubts really quickly on Piazza. He is funny in class. Good lectures. The exams are OK, but the last two exercises required LOTS of work, but I was proud the the finished products! A must for students interested in Webtech.",
      "Glad I took Prof. Papa class, as I want to get a job in Webtech. Waiting for my Final, I know I will get an A. Class was medium difficulty for me. Material will help me in getting an internship at Amazon, as it includes lectures and homeworks on AWS and cloud platforms like NodeJS. Thanks, Prof. Midterm was easy for me. The Android app was hard.",
      "Fabulous Prof. Very knowledgeable of the industry. Material is very good: NodeJS, AWS, Google Cloud platform, Bootstrap, jQuery, HTML5, Angular, and I did my mobile project on my iPhone. That will get me ready for my interviews with Google and Ebay. Prof answered all my doubts on Piazza, really quickly. Thanks, prof!",
      "Awesome class. Heavy on exercises, especially the last 2. Appreciate all the Javascript stuff, especially Node and Angular. Will help me with getting an internship next spring. Prof. Papa is hilarious, even with a class that is so frigging quiet. Highly recommended for students wanting a leg on on interviews.",
      "Great class. Great Prof. Papa. Material that I will keep. I'm trying to get a position as Grader for next semester. Will work for hard on the mobile app.",
      "Great class. Great prof. Exactly the stuff I need for my planned job. The last exercises are frigging tough but 'no pain no gain.' The students that complain about the mobile exercise toughness are losers. Who told you this was easy? Grow up! Thanks prof. Papa for a wonderful class.",
      "Unlike the student that posted 3 times (LOL) complaining about getting no help about Mobile, the homework specs are awesome, and the additional Hints and Clues files are plenty of help. I heard that this class has become harder but much better in material over the years. I really appreciated it covered tons of JS libraries. I'm glad I took it.",
      "Wasn't interested int the subject until this class. Now I'll go for a job in Webtech. Or maybe mobile computing. Thanks, Prof.",
      "Good lecture material. Prof. papa has a lot of industry experience and it shows in his lectures. Last mobile app was difficult, took me 3 week to finish completely. But I am happy I did it. Recommnded.",
      "Great Prof. Class is awesome! Took it in Fall 2015. Helped me get an internship at eBay this summer. If you are into webtech, it is a must take class.",
      "I like Prof. Papa and knowledge of the industry. I am now at Amazon on an internship and I got it all because of this class and a recommendation from the prof. The last 2 exercises are tough but they gave me the needed background for winning the intern.",
      "I like the material, useful for anyone interested in webtech. Prof is good, seems to have a lot of work experience on it. I had a few doubts and he answered on Piazza pretty mush right away. I recommend.",
      "I like Prof. Papa teaching. I learned about a lot of new tech like Nodes DOT js, cloud computing, Angular DOT js. But the most helpful was the mobile device project, tough but rewarding.",
      "He's so cool . Great stuff that will has helped me land a summer internship at Amazon.",
      "Excellent professor! Totally worth taking a class under him. Web tech is mandatory for a good job these days. Prof will give you all is needed.",
      "On of the best professors I have had at USC.",
      "This was a great experience. If you do not have good programming experience, you should NOT take this class. It is now very heavvy on programing, especially the last two assignment/ Professor puts together great projects. Lectures are good.",
      "Great professor.",
      "Pretty good instructor. Moves through the material VERY fast. Is a little awkward, but his jokes are funny at times like \"Silicon Valley\". Seems to really love teaching at USC. Class was hard for me, but not for others. Half the students get A and A-. I didn't get the best grade but I deserved it.",
      "Prof. Papa is a great teacher. He explains everything clearly. The class was a very good learning experience, very worthwhile. He clears all the doubts in Piazza within 5-10 minutes. I recommend this class.",
      "Professor Papa is one of the best professors at USC. He is always responsive and he is online on Piazza at any time of the day or night if you need help. CSCI 571 was an amazing class, especially if you are new to Web technologies. It was well-organized, interesting, and the lectures were great.",
      "Very hard, but good class. Last two exercises will take a long time. Prof is on Piazza all the time, it is funny. Got answered at 3AM.",
      "Very good professor. Tough homeworks. Highly recommended.",
      "This course made me learn a lot. It also gave me an hon-campus job in USC Housing and an internship at a local startup. Even the guest lectures helped as I was not familiar with Agile and Scrum and the company I am interning uses Scrum. Lectures are inspirational. Great stuff about jQuery, NodeJS, JSON, an mobile development. Exams are hard.",
      "I really learned a lot from this class. The last 2 homeworks are hard but rewarding, pushing me to learn new stuff. The class content is abundant and can easily relate to everyday life. Moreover, it's a practical course that I can apply immediately into industry. This summer I'll be interning at Expedia and I'm sure this class gives me a good start",
      "Love this prof. Material is very topical, especially the Cloud stuff, mobile development and new tech like Note JS. I wish more projects like the last 2. The earlier were too easy. Exams had a bit too much memorization, though. Prof is available on Piazza anytime.",
      "Prof. Papa makes this a hard class, especially the exercises that seem to become more and more difficult every semester, but the upside is that they are real examples of web apps and native mobile apps. I became a grader and then a Producer for the class and all that landed me a job at Amazon. Could not have do it without the help of Prof. Papa.",
      "Took the Course in the Spring 2015. The real value of the course is the fact that it prepared me for my Internship at Amazon and a subsequent OPT offer also at Amazon. Prof. Papa game me all the tools to beat many other student competing with me for those positions. This is a tough but great course. The memorization issue actually helped me.",
      "Just started the course and I am enjoying it very much. Prof. Papa always brings up historical tidbits about the Web that really put its development into perspective. I am really looking forward to doing an Ebay Web app and iOS app. I am also excited at the prospect of learning howe to use AWS. Lectures are long at times, though.",
      "Papa is one of the worst professor you will come across at USC. He has lot of attitude and is very abrasive. He makes fun when someone asks a silly question. Not at all fit to be a professor. However, the course is good if you are looking to add various skills to your resume.. Exam is all memory based. You have to mug up a lot.",
      "Although I have to say that Professor Papa is not that good at lecturing, but the the material covered in the lecture, oh no, ppt is fantastic! Almost cover everything important. I also love the assignment, which is clearly organized and useful for learning web developing. The only problem is the exam. You have to recite a lot from PPT.",
      "This course just winded down. Material was consistently updated. Prof. Papa gives feedback and student help using Piazza and it works: my questions were answered in a matter of minutes. I enjoyed the lectures on Bootsrap, JQuery and HTML5. These are going to help me when I look for a webtech job. I would love more live demos and more code samples.",
      "I am almost done with this class for Fall 2014, and it is getting progressively difficult. I have appreciated Prof. Papa additions of JQuery, Bootstrap and al the help he is giving us on the Android development (a new for me). Prof. Papa makes good use of the additional screen in SAL 101, with lots of demos for the code. Very good instructor.",
      "I'm in the middle of an internship obtained because of the material covered in Dr. Papa class. I know now that the class prepared me perfectly for the internship (lots of JavaScript, HTML5, Android API). Dr. Papa definitely nailed the material I needed to know. Exams were not easy and the mobile demo took lots of time, but it paid off for me.",
      "Just got my grade, A. Not an easy class, especially since the last exercises are pretty involved. Prof. Papa brings what seems a lot of industry experience and the lecture are always interesting as he makes use of multiple screens with all his iPads and MacBook. I was a able to get an internships real easily given the background I acquired.",
      "Just finished the Spring course. It was *not* easy! The last project was really complex, but I am glad I was able to finish it. The whole course was pretty intense, but having gotten through I came out with a lot of info that I can use in my job search in web tech. Prof. Papa has presented relevant material that already helped me get an internship.",
      "Excellent course and instructor. I am taking this class in my second semester at USC and I love the material. Prof. Papa is very good at showing us all web technologies and the history behind them. He is also very active on Piazza which makes it very easy to get doubts answered quickly. I think I will get get prepared to interview for web tech.",
      "Outstanding course. I ended up in the top 5%, and it was not easy, but the material is oustanding, and Prof. Papa knowledge of the industry is huge. I ended upbeing offered a DR, which is great. Highly recommended for masters students.",
      "I am through about 1/2 half of the course (we are having the midterm this week) and this course has been outstanding. The extra visual presentation, using multiple screens with macbook and iPads, in GFS 106 is probably helping, but the material is well constructed and I really appreciate Prof. Papa knowledge of the technology space.",
      "Just started taking this class. Earlier lectures are really cool. Also the classroom is amazing and Prof. Papa is using all the screens for a very good audio/video presentation. I am really looking forward to attend the rest of the course.",
      "I attended Papa's class in 2008 and his class is my favorite. The assignments are very well organized, and I was always impressed by his passion for new technology. Though the class is most about web tech, Papa also introduced the mobile development and it totally changed my life! As a senior mobile engineer, I really appreciate his help!",
      "Attending this class gave me access to an internship at Google. There is no book required, all the slides are available online, though I decided to attend the lectures so I could ask questions. Last semester we were able to do AWS and mobile project and it was awesome. Prof. Papa is a great instructor.",
      "thanks to the awesome guidance provided by Professor Papa this course broadened my skill set and gave me exposure to multiple web technologies also increased my interest in building web products. I would highly recommend this course under professor papa to everyone.",
      "Prof Papa is decent for graduate level. People who come in the class expecting to have their hand held will likely struggle. Going to class is not necessary because he simply reads off the slides, but when you ask well-formed questions online (Piazza) he'll respond (he says he doesn't reply to emails). Work is interesting assignments that are easy."

      "One of the best CSE professors, show comics at the beginning of every lecture. Though PAs are tough, you could learn a lot.",
      "Rick is a good professor. However CSE 30 has a ridiculous workload. It assumes that you only need to take this one course for the quarter. I need to spend like 2-3 whole days for the PAs every week, and this makes my life extremely unbalanced. The grading of those PAs are also strict, you can lose lots of points for minor errors.",
      "Rick's last year at UCSD and he is very straightforward in explaining concepts. His PAs are hard though I can still handle them. I would say if you want to learn something, take his class.",
      "Good lecturer. He really knows his stuff and is helpful, but programming assignments are a lot of work.",
      "I really enjoyed Rick's classes! He is responsible, hilarious, and always patient to answer any question from the students. Lots of homework, but also lots of extra credit. His programming assignments and quizzes do make me learn a lot. Would definitely take his class again!",
      "Class put me to sleep sometime but he really knows his stuff. Assessments were basically the same as what he posts online on his class webpage, so study those. Start early start often",
      "Rick teaches a lot of new materials during one lecture, so pay attention to every detail and ask questions immediately when lost. Just follow what Rick requires, try hard, and you will definitely get an A because he gives tons of extra credits during midterm and final for you to make up the points you lose on quiz and PA. Love him a lot^^",
      "Programming assignments are challenging but quizzes and exams are okay if u do exams and quizzes in previous quarter. His lecture and lecture notes are pretty good for learning.",
      "This class requires a lot of time and effort but Just learned so much and i purely think how much you put it in this class will determine your grade in the end. There are tons of practice midterm, quiz, finals on his website so there are really no excuse . Lastly the tutors are just awesome they are really knowledgeable. Start early start often",
      "The great (lower division) prof. There is EXTRA CREDIT in the homework assignments. PLEASE GO TO LECTURES. You can still pass the course if you miss classes, but why miss classes when you are able to learn the things you need for the course as well as for the future? The lectures are useful and humourous. There is NO GRADE PULL-UPS OR CURVES.",
      "Though difficult, most people can get an A through numerous extra credit from exams and assignments. Rick will give out previous exams for practice. His class will also get you prepared for more CSE courses.",
      "This class is notoriously hard, but he makes it seems pretty easy since he gives you like 10 years of previous exams with same format as tests, so test/quizzes are pretty easy. Just be sure to also study his notes, because he adds extra stuff not on previous exams in recent years; missed a lot of points bc I only did practice exam & got 89% :((((((",
      "The materials are not very hard for this class, and the exams are also fair to be honest, but you have to be very careful during the exam, since it's all about calculations. The first two PAs are easy, but the third PA is extremely hard!!! I spent my whole weekend and also skipped two days of classes but still didn't finish it.",
      "His classes are tough because he assigns a lot of PA (programming assignments) and quizzes. But if you really want to learn at a fast pace, he is a good professor. His assignment aren't hard but rather time consuming (think 10-15 hours a week if you're decently fast). Good thing: don't buy the book, the pdf is out there and I haven' used it anyways",
      "Rick is an excellent professor that cares about his students. His policy on programming assignments is very strict, but it's definitely worth what you will learn in his class.",
      "For anyone who has had some (you don't need to be the creator of java) programming experience, Rick does an amazing job of solidifying OOP concepts. His PAs (programming assignments) also pack a punch and will take a good chunk of your time, but as you'll hear often in this class, \"start early, start often\". Also, make use of his practice exams!",
      "One of the best! CSE11 requires students with programming background. It does not mean one semester with Python. You'd better have taken something like C/C++/java. If you do, you will find this course very helpful in many ways. HW is tough, but everything is VERY REASONABLE. Previous exams help a lot. You will learn a lot from him and won't forget.",
      "His lectures are ok. It covers a lot in a somewhat tedious and separated way. It's pretty informative if you're already good at programming, but, I guess, will be unreasonably hard for those who are not. Homework is terrible but it will test your will to be a programmer. Not the most respectful person you see in the world.",
      "The class itself isn't very hard, however there is A LOT of homework; the programming assignments are usually long and tedious and you can easily lose points along the way on stupid stuff. However, I did find some of them to be pretty fun to do. Tests and quizzes are pretty easy. Just study all of the previous exams and you'll do fine.",
      "Honestly, the hottest professor in the CSE department. Real Legend.",
      "Ord is a great professor who genuinely cares about his students. That said, CSE11 felt like a waste of time. The PA's take a long time to do simply because of how long it takes to parse through their long instructions and constraints, and the tests only contained a few questions on lecture material. On the plus side, he posts all old exams.",
      "Professor Ord was pretty good. His lectures can be a bit boring, and his jokes are either a hit or miss, but he attempts to make them interesting for an 8am class. There's weekly programming assignments that take a lot of time to do. But there's also tons of extra credit, and tons of tutors to help. As long as you don't procrastinate you'll ace it.",
      "He gives very clear lectures and wonderful handouts. The programming assignments are interesting. There are about 10% people got A+ in FA16 quarter. and about half received an A.",
      "He is amazing professor that show care to all his students. He is kind of humorous and really like to tell jokes in the class. He is middle- level lecturer, you may understand most of his lecture, but you may still need assistance from piazza. Even though there is no curve, You are very likely to get A or at least A- .",
      "Rick Ord is definitely a great professor. He goes very quick in lecture because there are a lot of materials to cover. His handouts are helpful. Getting an A is pretty easy in this class (over half people get A's). Make sure to \"Start Early, Start Often\" and pay attention to details for the PAs. Tests are somewhat tricky but he gives previous tests",
      "This review is for those didn't take AP CS/took a CS class but forgot nearly everything. I took CS8A and dropped CS8B my 1st year. Now for my 3rd year, I decided I would take CS11 because I didn't think I could do CS8B. CS11 was so difficult and was the bane of my existence every week. Be ready to do a lot of work on those PA's. Tests are okay.",
      "Tip for lecture-missers: If you don't attend lectures, at least make it for the beginning so you can get a handout (they are notes from the textbook that explain everything) I missed the midterm because my phone died overnight so my alarm didnt go off and I emailed Rick in panic but he gave me a percentage of my final grade as my midterm score!",
      "\"Start early, start often\" \"Think like a compiler; act like a run time environment\" Rick Ord 's lecture can be interesting; but his assignments are absolutely long but interesting and even inspiring.",
      "Prof Ord is really clear on grading criteria and gives solid interesting lectures. But CSE11 indeed is an accelerated class so he moves across his materials at a really fast pace (you really cannot afford to blank out in class), get ready to code and it's super important to stay self-efficient in this class with the resources provided.",
      "He's a great teacher who knows his curriculum very well. Mr. Ord's been teaching for many years and as a result, he knows exactly how to explain things so that you'll understand him. Take his class if you can!!!!!",
      "I'm not a great student, and I could have definitely tried harder in his class to get a good grade, but I learned a ton and I got a great fundamental understanding of Java. He's a little pompous, but who cares? He can back it up. And besides, eventually you're going to have to deal with someone whose personality you don't like. I had no problems.",
      "PA could be really long and took a lot of time.. Make a good use of previous quizzes and exams.. The class overall was not that hard.. Learned a lot from each PA",
      "He's an ok lecturer, sometime he goes too fast. His midterms and finals are really long, however he give you his old exams to practice which are really helpful. Hmmn.. I think he's a bit overrated it.",
      "Awesome lecturer. Although he went too fast sometimes, but he made the points crystal clear. PAs are fair, just remember to start early and start often. Do practice quizes/midterms/finals and you will be on the right track to get an at least an A.",
      "love him!!!! TAKE HIM I PROMISE YOU WILL LOVE HIM TOO. Not only is he super duper smart, HE KNOWS HOW TO TEACH. He tells you the background information of what is going on in java that other professors don't usually go over. Book is needed to reiterate over some concepts, but if you go over the notes that he provides, you'll be fine.",
      "Good professor! His lecture is very interesting. Exam is similar to practice exam.",
      "I came in with zero programming experience except for a small Java class in high school. Surrounded by many AP and beyond students, it was quite intimidating. Nonetheless, I put in about 10-12 hours a week on the hardest PAs and maybe around 5 for the easier ones. I really recommend him if you know you have the drive.",
      "Lectures are super clear. I came in with APCS knowledge but goofed around all quarter until the final. Aced that and got the A. Lots of extra credit opportunities in labs and exams. Attended may be half the classes. DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK, his notes cover everything you ever need to know.",
      "Great teacher, great class. the programming assignments are long but fun if you start early. Sometimes his lectures can be very long but definitely recommend going. He definitely has his stuff together",
      "He is a great professor. He makes concepts extremely easy to understand. Programming assignments are simple. Previous quizzes and midterms are given and are almost the same as the real tests. He is so far the best professor I have ever met. Don't need textbooks if you have programming background except for one PA. Really easy to get A+.",
      "PA's can sometimes be long, expect 7-8 hours per week on some longer projects. Quizzes are extremely easy, and so are the midterms. Do not really NEED to go to lecture, but it is definitely recommended. No need to buy the textbook.",
      "You have to earn the grade, but he gives you all the resources to do so. Great professor, great class, even if it is difficult.",
      "Great professor! The practice exams are exactly the same as your exams, and you are given the last ten years of exams. Very simply to do very well on exams given all this practive! Expect a lot of homework. The assignments are long, some enjoyable, others just a pain to complete. Definitely recommend Rick!",
      "Rick is simply brilliant! His lectures keep you so engaged and you can feel yourself learning. I had no Java experience prior to this class, but Rick made everything clear and I ended up becoming pretty experienced in Java by the end of the class. His quizzes and exams are very straightforward. Homework is time consuming, but make use of tutors!",
      "I enjoyed Ord's CSE 11 class very much. The guy is clear on everything, and all of the assignments are just fun to do. He provides all of his past exams and quizzes to study from, and they reflect what you'll be seeing on them in class. Just a great experience overall.",
      "Truly a great professor. I heard a bit about Ord before taking this class so I was stoked when I got him for CSE30. Never missed a lecture and never wanted to. Some concepts are tricky, but Ord magically simplifies it to make it easy to grasp. I will miss being in this class and hope to cross paths with him again someday.",
      "By far my favorite professor and class at UCSD. Ord has a clear passion for both the subject and his students' learning. His lectures are very easy to follow, and the way he explains concepts makes them really easy to understand. The class uses clickers, but you'll want to show up for this class anyway.",
      "At all cost take this professor. His connection toward the students is very strong and improves your passion toward CS. Highly recommended for it is not often I find great professors like him. His lectures are meant to \"supplement\" the readings from the books but his enthusiasm in lecture makes learning better than reading the book.",
      "Writing down notes onto the slides he gives out really helps, otherwise you're going to have a bad time.",
      "Lecture note handouts are super helpful. Programming assignments are long, but there are only 4 per quarter (there are checkpointsmilestones, however). The writeups for the PAs are detailed but leave out the specific implementation details, so you have to think for yourself a bit. Quizzes and exams are straightforward (look at past years'!)",
      "Rick is a great professor. There are practice quizzes, midterms and finals on his website that are nearly identical to the real things. You will spend a lot of times in the lab on the assignments. Easy to get an A, but it's very time consuming.",
      "He is a really good professor if you pay attention to his lectures, answers questions well. You definitely need a study group to get through this class.",
      "Great lecturer. Makes things crystal clear. Genuinely seems to care about students success in the classroom as well as in the field. He's straightforward about what will be on his tests and final, and they are very fair. He's very helpful and involved with his students as well - communicating is easy with Ord. Overall great professor!",
      "Best Professor I've had at UCSD. He goes over every concept in detail, even trivial topics to make sure you understand what's going on. The homework is very time consuming and at times very difficult, but the tests are very fair if you've been paying attention.",
      "I took Ord fall 2013. This guy is the best CS professor that is out there! While he can talk a bit too fast at times, especially when he is talking about SPARC stack frames, this guy is just the best professor at explaining things. The class is definitely a LOT of work, but if you are a dedicated person and do all of your work you will do great!",
      "One of the best teachers at UCSD. Class is just not easy.",
      "Best professor at UCSD. At least the best computer science professor you'll ever have, so enjoy it while it lasts! :)",
      "Rick is awesome. Definitely my favorite class this quarter. The programming assignments were very fun. It was my first time taking a programming class, was hard at first, at the end things were easy.",
      "Rick knows his stuff and he will gladly do everything he can to make sure you understand if you are willing enough to be bold and ask. He is very fair, but he expects you to work hard. You might need some confidence to ask him questions though, he definitely takes pride in explaining everything as clear as he can.",
      "Ord is a great teacher. He really knows the material. The notes he provides are exceptional and good to hold on to for future references. Overall, I thought his projects reflected what we were learning and were very helpful.",
      "Very good at explaining the concepts. Tests are fair and I should have got an A+ if it wasn't for a brain shutdown on on the midterm. Will def. sign up for future classes with Rick.",
      "Lectures can be boring at times, but the note handouts are well worth going for. Easy tests/quizzes if you just review the notes and use common sense. Programming assignments usually straightforward but were tricky at times...get started early!",
      "Really easy professor. I think the class average was like a B+ with most people getting an A on the final. Lectures may be boring, but he's really easy to understand if you actually listen. Lectures are not necessary, but you might want a friend who goes to lectures since he puts those \"favorite coffee\" types of questions on the test.",
      "Fair Grading. Ord is helpful. Attend lectures and labs. Textbook needed if you have no previous experience in programming.",
      "Quizzes/midterms/final are really easy if you study the past tests that he provides online. Programming assignments can be challenging unless you get lucky and get a genius partner.",
      "If you've taken a class with him before, you pretty much know how the class is going to go. Quizzes and exams are almost exactly like the practice/previous ones he has listed on his website, and the programming assignments were pretty fair (just make sure you start SUPER early!)",
      "He is a fairly lenient teacher and the class average what somewhere around B+. The exams are fairly easy though the only hard part of his class would be the programming assignments though with proper help from TAs it shouldn't be much of a problem if you do it in advance.",
      "I wish there was a University of California, Rick Ord.",
      "Awesome teacher, really easy to follow lectures, tests are relatively easy and doable, esp. with allowed cheatsheets. Probably the only professor that makes you love programming much, as he is passionate about the subject himself. TAKE HIM!",
      "Brilliant professor, I learned so much in 15L. The thing that always surprises me about Ord is how much you learn, and how knowledgeable he is. Can answer any and all questions totally throughly, and all assignments and exams are really tailored well towards learning what's important.",
      "Came in with no prior introduction to programming. Learned cool new stuff. It was an morning class, but his lecture was interesting enough that i remembered most of the things he said and passed the extremely easy tests. All that i needed to pass the test were pen, basic knowledge of java programming, coffee, and rationality.",
      "Start the 2nd project as soon as the specification is out (typically a lot of people got killed because of this). Because of the 2nd project, this class is basically converted into another extremely BS assembly class like CSE30. Ord however is a very good lecturer and really cares about how his students learn.",
      "great professor! everything is very straightforward. definitely made me even more excited to be a CS major!",
      "Take as many classes with him as possible. His lectures are very clear and easy to understand, yet the homeworks challenge you enough to understand the concepts even more. I find it very surprising that despite how great of a prof he is, less than half of the students come to lectures regularly. He makes you understand everything very well.",
      "Awesome teacher. Very fair with his grading but you have to read all his extremely helpful handouts and do the practice midterms and quizzes he has on his website. The programming assignments are not easy but if you start EARLY and go to discussion you should be fine.",
      "Honestly one of the few good CSE teachers at UCSD. If you see any of his classes offered and you have a requirement that he fulfills. Take his class. Fair, concise, no tricks, teaches coherent understandable material. No politics and no bullsh*t. Great teacher. You'll be hard pressed to find better at the sh*t factory that UCSD is.",
      "Compared to 8A last quarter, I felt as though he actually taught material a lot better. Quizzes were fairly simple if you read the topics he tells you to look up. Programming assignments are pretty challenging. Midterm and final were simple. Overall, pretty good class. Thumbs up for Rick Ord!.... and a huuzah as well.",
      "He makes it easy for us (thank god, it was a slight break from CSE 30). Long story short, only 10 people didn't get A's on the final. 'Nuff said.",
      "Good god could they make this class any easier&#63;!! He's a cool prof I guess, but if you're familiar with computers...this class is a joke, a stupid 6th college ge...you'd better get an A. Rarely went to class, always went to lab, got an A. Used the textbook maybe once or twice, borrow or share with a friend don't buy it...",
      "This is my first programming class and let me start off by saying that Rick Ord is probably the most engaging and passionate teacher I have ever had. Very clear lectures, and If you notice that he repeats what he says alot to make sure that everyone understands. The quizes and exams are tricky...Pay close attention. Ord is the more caring professor",
      "Professor is pretty eh. A bit stubborn and selfish. Lectures are very random too; all you is look at code and figure out what it does. Quizzes are specific, no way to prepare for them besides knowing everything about CS. Class is supposed to assume no prior knowledge of CS, but he teaches as if you already have prior knowledge of the material.",
      "He's the best!!! Over 80% of the class got 90%+ on the final! The lowest was 77%. His notes are the most useful thing ever! He even add stuff that are not in the book, which will most likely appear on the quiz. The quizzes are also very helpful, since they WILL prepare you for the midterm/final!!!",
      "this class will probably make you a good CS student if you can find a way to stay interested in the material. if not it'll feel like you're beating your head against the wall for 10 weeks. pass the advil please&#63; book is useless, because prof teaches different stuff. also, it's nice that he prints notes for us, but it'd be better if he posted them.",
      "Its really easy, but you will learn a lot of things form his class!!!!",
      "He's probably the best teacher I've ever had. He really engages you in the material and has a passion for teaching. His lectures go beyond the surface level and he explains things in a way that is easier to understand.",
      "Great teacher! Easy to take notes in class. Tests are straight forward.",
      "You can tell he really knows what he's doing, and he wants you to understand as well. Didn't study and got a B+. The lab's are a pain sometimes, but I think they're working out the kinks. Anyways, take him if you have to take this class!",
      "real easy class, yet i slacked off. He's a funny teacher, makes things understandable. dont buy the textbook. go to class, boring at times but he gives out funny extra credit answers for the quiz :]",
      "Funny guy. I learned a lot from him.",
      "Really easy class, but attending lecture is highly recommended because he puts random fact questions on quizzes from class. but even if you do horrible on quizzes, the labs really operate as a grade booster. midterm 1 page front as cheat sheet, final 1 page front/back as cheat sheet.",
      "Great prof, very clear, occasionally funny, nice...really easy class. Don't need to buy the textbook, notes are online..just have to listen in lecture for little facts that aren't in the notes for the quizzes and tests. Very straightforward labs.",
      "very easy. lectures can get boring sometimes.",
      "Definitely one of the best, if not THE best, CSE professors in UCSD. He has very clear lectures, easy quizzes to study for (the questions on the quizzes are very straight forward and they can be very prepared by reading the book and his lecture notes), and he is a very funny and entertaining professor. If you don't take Rick, you're missing out.",
      "Best cs prof I had so far. Lectures are crucial, since the materials are somewhat difficult but Ord explains them very clearly. No curve, uses a lot of questions from the past quizzes and exams. Start at least 5 days before program assignment is due, since they take from 15~20+ hours to complete. Keep on track and it'll be a breeze!",
      "Professor Ord is amazing. He loves to tell jokes and stray away from the material but there's nothing to lose! The material was easy. I never used the bookg so purchasing is not needed. Go to lecture, Go to lab and you'll be fine!",
      "Absolutely great professor. Gives excellent notes and goes through them thoroughly, making a lot of material a breeze. Posts past quizzes and finals. The only thing difficult about 30 is the programming assignments, and they aren't too bad; they just take a LOT of time, which is bad if you're busy. Start early on programming and you have an easy A.",
      "If you fail this class, you fail at life. This class is so easy it's ridiculous. He's a really nice guy, but he's really annoying too cause he tries to be funny, and fails, hard. If you understand all of the material, don't bother with lecture, but if you don't, go.",
      "Ord is a super nice, friendly, and easy-to-understand teacher. Try to go to lectures because they really are helpful and it's easy to get in the habit of skipping them. Labs are a piece of cake. Cheat sheets allowed! In the beginning of class he told us that if we didn't get an A, we probably missed a test and never went.",
      "Ord is a great professor and a really cool, average joe type of guy. He really tries hard to teach you stuff that you will actually be able to use regardless of your major and he does a good job of it. The lab was fun and interesting too. It would be silly to take this class with anyone else.",
      "Easy for the most part. You should attend lectures but not really mandatory for you to pass. Labs are 40% and very easy - the TAs pretty much walk you through them each week.",
      "Ord is awesome! Everyone should take him for CSE!! He's really funny and helpful and the class is really easy. All you have to do is show up to labs and you'll get an A!",
      "Easy class as long as you attend labs and take the quizzes. Class itself is really boring but go because he gives you answers to quizzes.",
      "Very easy class, just make sure to attend lectures. he goes over everything that will be on quizzes and allows a cheat sheet for midterm and final. Labs are worth 40% of grade and they're SO easy. Great prof, easy class.",
      "He's totally awesome and fun to have. He makes the class fun and wants the students to excel. Take him if you get the chance.",
      "Excellent professor. Take him whenever possible! He posts lots of his old quizzes and tests online. Not much bad I can say about him except that when I took his class, he was reformulating the curriculum a little and the new parts of the programming assignments were confusing. He probably has it straightened out by now.",
      "The best teacher I have seen in CS at UCSD. He is excellent at clarifying difficult issues and REALLY cares about his students. That is so important, and most teachers are not like that. He really is awesome. I'm glad he is the compilers teacher (CSE 131). The only negative thing about the class is the notes might get a little convoluted, be neat.",
      "The coolest cse prof you'll ever have. Great sense of humor, down to earth and very good at teaching. Strong command of material. Knows how to deliver material that could easily be very bland a dry otherwise. Quizzes are a bit rushed, but all his old quizzes are posted on website so you know what he will ask. I highly recommend him!",
      "This class is easy. Go to class because he goes over everything that shows up on the quizzes. Exams are easy, he let's you have a cheat sheet, and deinitely study the previous quizzes and exams. Labs are definitely a grade booster. This class is an easy A. He's pretty nice and chill too. I'd definitely recommend. Book helps to clarify, not necessar",
      "Ord is the man. If you can ever take a class with this guy do it. Unlike other professors who believe you learn best through failing grades and ridiculous quizzes and exams, Ord simply teaches the material really well and gives fair exams.",
      "His class= easy+useful+relax :P go take his class even though it's not an requirement for ur major or college",
      "This instructor is the best CS teacher I have ever had. His lectures are very clear. His grading is somewhat easy ( I expected an 91% on my final but I got 98%). He provides you with a lot of sample exams (so there are no surprises). GOLDEN ADVICE: practice the sample exams before you go take the exam, and ur A is guaranteed!",
      "the class in general is easy, this prof makes it even easier. He's funny and really nice though sometimes it feels like he's wasting your time. Has an affinity for the pub too. Other than that, really fair about quizzes and exams.",
      "Amazingly wonderful prof. A welcome breath of fresh air after 12. Go to class and pay attention, you'll learn what you need- as well as be entertained by his tangents. Fair grading. All previous quizzes/exams linked to site. Easy to get extra credit. Just make sure to start early on the projects, the labs tend to be too full near the due date.",
      "Makes an excruciating class somewhat tolerable. Demonstrates exuberance and excitement about his field that is lacking in other CS professors. Has good rapport with students. Very difficult programming assignments, but they are tolerable knowing that the professor seems genuinely interested in teaching and not just destroying your soul for sport.",
      "Unlike CSE 12 with Gillespie, you spend more energy learning and less energy ripping your hair out. His quizzes, midterm and final are extremely similar to the ones from previous quarters, so it's really easy to get your grade. But don't take this for granted and ignore the class because there is a**** LOAD to learn here: the material learned WILL show up in job interviews and future classes.",
      "Great class, programming assignments took time, but weren't insane like cse12. Tests were actually reflective of the material. Funny guy with an actual personality.",
      "i think i went to lecture twice this quarter... i got a B ... i am not a computer person, enough said&#63;",
      "I thought this class was going to be an easy A but I spent so much time trying to get it this class was frustrating! Lectures were really boring sometimes too. Nice professor though, REALLY nice, gives prizes in class and is relaxed and funny too, unlike me...",
      "He is a very nice guy who trys to make class fun with comics. He puts his lecture slides online and spends class time on other stuff so he doesn't have much time for lecture. An easy class and you can definitely pass without going, but a lot of the stuff he talks about in class that isn't online shows up on the test. Tests are easy enough.",

      "Awesome prof... definitely worthwhile to take. 420 baby!!! Anyone thats taken him, you know what i'm talkin' about.",

      "No Comments",
      "Of all the CS professors on campus, this is the only one that rocks. He'll ask you what questions you want on the midterm, then read them out to the class, providing feedback as to whether they should be on there or not. Compilers class sucks... but this",
      "Ord is definitely one of the best CSE professors. His teaching style actually helps you learn and understand the material, while remaining interested. Programs do take a lot of time, but you will know your material inside and out by the end of the quarter.",
      "If you're a CS major looking for relief after Gillespie, Rick's your man. Although the programs may be a bit tedious, the knowledge you gain and the way he presents the information are intriguing. You'll come out having learned much more than you did in CSE 12.",
      "Good proffessor, learned a lot. Don't buy the book. His course notes suffice.",
      "If the quarter you're taking it hasn't started yet, I really recommend you going to the website (ieng9.ucsd.edu/~cs30x) and download all the past quizzes/exams NOW. no links to them once the quarter starts. Easy class, there are readings but you don't have to do them, save money don't buy the book.",
      "His reputation preceeds him... What are you doing reading this, take his class now!!!",
      "He is a good professor....apparently one of the nest in the CSE deptt...he is a cool guy and likes his students to learn a great deal in this class....but 1 caution,dont go for extra credit in his class.....for 1 point of credit,you will have to work a lot....but otherwise he is a great guy....",

      "CS majors can't escape taking Ord at least once; believe me, once is enough to convince anyone that he is one of the greatest instructors, if not THE greatest instructor in the CS department. His comics, sense of humor, and endless knowledge make every lecture worth attending. Go Ord! (More coffee&#63;)",
      "funny guy. quizes and tests are just like the sample ones he gave out. not too good about posting the assignment on time, which sucks because you only have so much time to write your programs. pretty good class, if you're not tOOO bad at programming",

      "Fantastic teacher, the best I've had in the CS department so far. Lectures are clear and easy to follow, pretty easy to get a good grade in; I think the average in my class was in the mid 80s.",
      "Best CS teacher I've had. Programming assignments aren't overly difficult, and he gives tests/quizzes that are very similar to the practice ones he puts on the website. Pretty easy to get a good grade in this class.",
      "excellent professor",
      "Super nice teacher! homeworks are hard if you don't get it, but there's a lot of TA's to help you so you're most likely to get A's for homework. Midterms aren't bad since you can bring a sheet of notes with you. It's pretty easy to get A for this class.",
      "good teacher, hands out clear and descriptive notes, helpful, easy class, had 17 great TAs, no great need to read the book, but good if you want more examples and information",
      "Great teacher, teaches material well, i just hope i pass the class :o",
      "Despite not getting a very good grade in the class, Ord is still one of the best. His lectures aren't boring and he explains the material well.",

On cs241 the assignments are hard but Troy is incredibly active on Piazza and always available on office hours to give feedback. Exams are pretty fair",

He really walks you through the content and you get a thorough understanding of how compilers work. The only course I have made EVERY effort to attend! 1010, all my female friends have crushes on him. Some guys do too!",

Really do your best to keep up, do all the pre labs and worksheets and screencasts and bitfits and maybe you'll be fine.",

      "A solid professor. Lectures are generally enthusiastic. It's an easy A+ if you know how to code and you stay on track. However, it is time-consuming, especially the project. Do not skip the lectures. If you miss a lecture, catching up on the material is difficult, since there's no textbook and the readings contain insufficient examples.",

      "Good professor. But.. he basically goes through problems that are already posted online (with solutions). Organized slides, everything's cool. The course however, is brutal. Stay on top of everything or else you're doomed. Don't dig yourself into a hole...",
      "Prof Carter is very clear about everything ( his students know clearly what to do and what to expect all the time ). His screencasts capture the most important points. His exercises and labs are helpful and exams are fair. Overall, Prof carter is an amazing professor !",
      "His screencasts are exactly what you need to understand the course. As long as you regularly watch and understand them, you can learn the class without actually going to class. That's how great they are! His assessments (labs and quizzes) are as straightforward as you can get in terms of applying the subject matter. Nice and simple.",
      "Paul keeps the lectures interesting. His screencasts and lectures go over everything you need to know. he is organized and as long as you pay attention, take notes and practise coding every now and then its easy to get a good mark in his class.",
      "Great professor. I entered the class with basically no interest in programming and left finding it interesting. The course workload is reasonable and I literally have not had to use the textbook at all. Paul Carter is very good at explaining things and is always willing to help if you have questions.",
      "Was very helpful and explained what he did if people needed more help. Always tried to engage the lecture hall. Need to know how to problem solve, but no prior programming knowledge in necessary. Need clicker.",
      "Great prof, a favorite so far. Very systematic teaching style, and will go out of his way to help students. Easy to understand. However do try to dodge his \"constructive criticism\".",
      "CPSC 210 itself was a bit of a disappointment, but Paul is the best instructor I've had in my life. The majority of the computer science department at UBC is wonderful, but I don't think it gets much better than Paul, his explanations are crystal clear and he's better at answering questions than anyone I've seen. I very highly recommend him.",
      "Crystal clear.",
      "Really good teacher, he's a little strict but he has control of the class. My favorite first year professor.",
      "He is a good prof, but it's just the course that's brutal..... I don't suggest to take CPSC 210, unless it's your requirement, but, for sure, take Paul's other courses.",
      "Pretty much does all the teaching for you. Textbook is a guideline but with him as your prof, you don't really need anything else. Overall great prof. Tricky course but his teaching style is fantastic.",
      "Clear and comprehensive speaker. His authority is immediately recognized in class. He explains everything to the smallest detail and maximizes the learning possibilities for his sTudents",
      "Came into the class with no background knowledge and he taught the course so clearly. Great prof.",
      "He is probably the best professor I will ever have. He has a very effective teaching style, crystal-clear screencasts, and good humour :) Also, love his accent! Very sad to find out that he only teaches first 8 weeks of this course :(",
      "hes nice",
      "A really good prof, really helpful. Listen to him every class because if you do not, you will be lost. He is very helpful too. He is just a great prof in general.",
      "It's really sad I prob will never have a prof as clear as him anymore. He is like &quot;this is what you need to know and here is how to do it&quot;. No unnecessary talks which saves tons time. He makes the course easy and programing fun. if you are looking for a fun entertaining prof he's not the option but a clear helpful prof he is the top choice.",
      "THe best prof i've had in first year engineering by a landslide and he's a comp sci teacher! I wish he taught every class",
      "Good prof overall.His lectures are easy to understand and his thoughts are clear to follow.Very patient. Great Prof =]",
      "Paul Carter is AWESOME. I wish every prof were like him. His teaching style is somewhat unique and works extremely well. Everyone I know loves him. He's a legend.",
      "Amazing screen casts. the best prof. i've ever came across!",
      "PAUL CARTER ROCKS MY WORLD. his 30 minute screencasts (watched at home) explain basics. in-class problems expose you to more advanced problems, prepare you for labs+exams. WARNING: clicker questions pretty much eliminate sleepers/skippers. (in 8 am classes, very important!) overall, apsc 160 was a very enjoyable course.",
      "Great teacher that really wants to help his students to do good in the class",
      "This guy knows how to teach. Probably one of the clearest instructors i've ever had. Everything is crystal clear, his explanations and examples are brilliant. Also he is available for help, to aid through the learning. I like this teacher",
      "Honestly, if every engineering class were taught the way Paul Carter taught APSC 160, then engineering would be so much easier. Honestly, UBC needs more professors like him.",
      "awesome teacher! makes me want to do comp sci.",
      "A rare find these days, a teacher that actually CARES about how the students are doing and about their learning. He is always available for help and is always willing to help you, he actually wants you to do well in the course, his method of teaching is somewhat unique where there are no lectures but it's extremely effective aposed to traditional.",
      "Carter's a cool Englishman who has great teaching techniques. His teaching style is special and it worked very well for me. His screen casts and work sheets were really helpful.",
      "He's got to be the best prof I've had all year. Gets the content across very well.",
      "A great Prof.",
      "Very helpful, makes things easy to understand. Only reason people would find him as rude is that he doesn't tolerate people talking while he's talking, which is a good thing. Best prof I've had so far.",
      "great prof. highly recommended.",
      "Excellent prof, one of my favourites in first year. The fact that I managed an A+ without any previous programming experience speaks volumes of how well of a job he does teaching the course material",
      "Paul Carter teaches the material for 211 in a very clear manner with plenty of supporting material referenced in the textbook and elsewhere. The class is highly Java-centric, which is a flaw IMHO, but not the fault of the professor. There were only four assignments and they were all easy; I would have appreciated more. I would recommend this prof.",
      "BEST computer science prof. Totally clear and knows his material so well. The only question is why can't all profs be like him&#63;!",
      "Great teacher.",
      "one of my Best profs in 1st year engineering",
      "Holy GOD this man can teach. He actually does examples and forces everyone to participate in working on them during lecture time. You won't hesitate for a second to ask him questions in class.",
      "Awesome professor. Very friendly and helpful if you ask him questions, and very knowledgeable. Fantastic!",
      "Marking was very tough and I didn't enjoy the lectures very much.",
      "Great instructor. My favourate instructor.",
      "Professional. The man commands respect. He knows what's he doing and know how to teach it. I've never programmed a thing before taking this class and I ended up with 90% in the end. Labs can be tricky. Notes are better than the text. If you're not in his class, transfer now. And yes, he's got a lovely accent. =)",
      "Truly a great prof. He is smart, organised, sincere, makes a strong effort in the class to maintain order and get a clear message across (even though the material is obscure). If you go to him for help - don't piss him off. Switch into his class at all cost though - he's that good. I knew no programming and I got 80 on the final.",
      "Great Prof, alot of examples and his teaching is very clear and easy. He tends to be quite helpful throughout the course and encourages questions and discussion in class.",
      "Very good instructor.",
      "good prof",
      "Awesome prof. Explains everything very well, labs are ridiculously easy, and even if you have no programming experience (like me) this is one of the easiest courses you will ever take, so long as you put the time in.",
      "I loved this class. The assignments were challenging and really stimulated me to think about the topics described in class.",
      "The best course I've taken in my two years here, and probably the best prof I'll ever have. I completely enjoyed going to class.",
      "Excellent prof. He explains concepts clearly and well, and is receptive to questions. I enjoyed his lecture style very much. And indeed, he has a lovely accent.",
      "This guy is fantastic. his lecture style is smooth and clear and he writes code on the board (by hand) and then goes over it. if i had just gone to this lecture in the beginning, i would still be enrolled in the comp sci program. instead i was in wolfman's lecture and now i am leaving. the disparity is really that big.",
      "Best first year prof that I have. All you have to do is print out his notes and make sure you PAY ATTENTION (and fill out the notes)! He's very helpful and has a lovely accent. Definitely one of the best prof's on campus.",
      "lovely accent",
      "best prof I've had at ubc so far. Very efficent when teaching. Has very good control of the class. Overall is well organized. definately recommend being in his class if you have a course that he teaches",
      "NOT GOOD",
      "Note: you don't have to worry about his &quot;easiness&quot; rating. Last year, both sections/profs had same labs, midterms, and final. So u don't have a choice",
      "Excellent professor. Explains concepts clearly and logically in a manner which everyone understands. Seems to be one of the few professors at UBC who excels at teaching.",
      "Paul puts together organized and clear notes, and is helpful outside and inside class. However, his nature is to begin each interaction as a confronation. Most questions that do not involve clarifying class material are met with a &quot;why should I let you do that&quot; kind of approach. This is not to say he unreasonable; he is reasonable and logical.",
      "Excellent teacher. Probably the best UBC prof ive ever had. Lectures are very clear, slides very organized. If you go ask him questions he'll always answer it. Exams are very fair; no tricks involved. If youve been following along in class and doing labs, its easy to pass with flying colours.",
      "My favourite first year prof",
      "Best Prof Ever.",
      "Dr. Carter is definitely one of the best teacher I've ever had. His lecturing skill is so good that the 12 diciples would have abandoned jesus and become computer scientists. I would pay twice the money to just get in his class. So happy to be his student that my tears are coming down as i rite this",
      "He is one of the best prof! =)",
      "great prof. gives useful advice during office hrs. uber flexible. i failed both midterms miserably and passed the course with an above class avg mark. totally couldn't have done it without his help and encouragement. thank you sooo much dr. carter!",
      "Paul is one of those teachers whos ability to simplify complex material makes this challenging course manageable. The course is jam pact with assignments, midterms and labs which are extremely time consuming. You will learn a ton and I highly recomend this teacher.",
      "he's the greatest prof i've ever seen! I have never had a teacher that explains things so well like him. Kind of sad that he only teaches us for the first part of the courses. Now I almost fall asleep in class with the second prof who teaches the second part of the course.",
      "Dr. Carter is so awesome! He totally goes over eveything in class until like EVERYONE gets it. He also posts the notes for everything he does in class on webCT so you dont have to waste time writing everything down. He is by far my best professor this year!",
      "I didn't know jack**** about java (or any other language) b4 going to his class. But he was crytal clear in his lectures and quite helpful (albeit a little intimidating at first), but I still wound up with an A =D",
      "You really need to know how to do the assignments or have someone teach you or else you're pretty much dead. It's like a language, you have to learn the language in order to achieve in this course. But the prof is really approachable and he tries to help.",
      "great prof! Knew my name the first time I went into his office!",

      "Dr.Carter's notes are very organized and helpful. He is a very nice guy and helps students as much as he can. However, his exams are not that easy. PS Projects are not easy too. He is still my favorite CS prof. Dr. CARTER is recommended.~~~~",
      "Great prof! Very clear, Very helpful!",
      "great prof and great instruction",
      "He's the best prof!!! He's engaging and very patient, if you have questions, just email him or ask after class, he's totally receptive.",
      "Very organized,anwers students' mail fairly quickly!He has this boyish charm which makes the class all the more fun!CPSC 111 is more fun because of him~He's doing ALMOST all the work for both sections so that's why it's recommand that you go for his class",
      "Extremely organized and understandable. He is by far the best CPSC prof I've ever had. I'll definitely take more courses with this prof. He makes everything so clear. If you don't understand his lecture, then something's wrong with you.",
      "Great prof (helpful and instructive), but unforunately cpsc 111 is hard not matter which prof u have.",
      "Very well organized. Understading.",

      "I had Mark last year for CSC121. I feel like he delivered the best learning experience I ever had at UofT . If you are afraid of CS courses you honestly do not need to be anymore because he teaches from a place of understanding that all students have varying levels of experience. He's admirable and truly knowledgable.",
      "He is so nice! Very clear and informative lectures! He is also very patient when answering questions.",
      "I am currently taking his csc309, I don't think this overall quality score is fair enough for him, he is a great prof and he do want students to get a high mark, if u didn't it sadly because u are bad lol",
      "People just complain about his final but the truth is it was fair and covered what was taught in the course. I did ok on it and some of my friends got close to perfect so it wasn't impossible. People who don't study just like to complain. The prof himself is good and the exam is not the only part of the course. Study!",
      "Mark is awesome! I was actually excited to go to class and learn about programming. He breaks down the difficult concepts into easy to understand pieces.",
      "Fun course! Mark is really helpful during class and helped me understand programming. Assignments are mostly fair and you can definitely do well if you put in the work.",
      "I used to get terrified by cs courses until Mark came along. The way he teaches makes the concept so much easier to understand. He is knowledgable and explains everything clearly. Exercises are closely related to lectures and labs, but the assignment could be a real torture. Tests are fair if you pay attention to the lecture. Take his class!",

She: 1) Always responds to emails promptly 2) Explains things easily with props (Keuring machine lmao) 3) Gives tips about labs 4) Makes exams identical to problem sets or in-class examples 5) Accesible after class, at office hours or you can make an appointment The only annoying thing is pop quizzes (almost every Thursday)",
      "She really wants the students to learn, and tries to think of unique ways to get her message across. She has an accent, but you can still easily understand her. She has a lot of different grading criteria, such as pop quizzes, online quizzes, and exams. The exams are not heavily weighted, which is nice. No powerpoint with notes.",
      "She's a great professor when it comes to explaining, teaching you how to think about the concepts, and how to apply the concepts properly. She really sets the bar high for professors which allows you to appreciate her class. I don't show up to a lot of classes because I feel I can learn better alone but I never missed one of her classes.",
      "She's probably my favorite professor at U of A thus far, she's a engaging lecturer who explains the sometimes obtuse concepts very, very clearly. She also is very open to helping students outside of class if they need. My only gripe with her is that it seemed like she spent a little too much time on certain concepts and rushed through others.",

      "For 174, she is the best. Explains very clearly. If u are a Computing Science major, U cannot get a start better than this.",
      "Best professor I have had (yet). She does a good job at getting the tougher concepts across by using analogies. By attending all the lectures you will learn everything you need to do well in the course. The exams are pretty easy, so don't stress over them, and make sure to get online vignettes over with asap.",

      "As a student majoring in psychology, comp sci was out of my realm. The first time I attempted to fill my credits I took comp sci 101 with prof Kerolus. It was a horrible experience that made me feel like I would never complete this credit. Sadaf works hard for her students to succeed, if you are in the same situation as me DO YOUR CLASS WITH SADAF",
      "Sadaf is frankly an amazing prof. She always makes an effort to help students understand concepts in class, going fairly slow and reiterating important ideas. She is very accessible in office hours and is always very pleasant. She won't test on anything absurd, and is reasonable in her expectations for what we learned. Take 174 with her.",
      "Amazing professor, and no I'm not just saying that because I got a decent mark. I passed with a B+ but I worked for that mark. However, Sadaf is a really passionate prof who cares about her students. Visit her office for help with anything from the lab to the in-class material. Midterm and final were both fair. Easily the best prof I've had.",

      "Sadaf Ahmed teaches a very good introductory Computer Science course. The content of the course itself may be difficult for absolute beginners, but Sadaf is ready to help and answer any questions you may have. If you have any previous programming knowledge like I did, this class is an easy A.",

The online videos you have to watch in the beginning are super annoying but really important to establish base knowledge. Go to class and follow along and you'll do great.",
      "Amazing Prof, a touch repetitive, but perhaps necessary in an introductory course. Very helpful and I came out feeling I learned a huge amount about programming. My only beef is her love of Comic Sans. Ugh, the font burns my eyes.",
      "Really liked prof Ahmed. Found her approachable and easy to understand. She was often repetitive with certain questions or concepts, but it definitely helped me remember things (may differ for you depending on how you learn). Had her during Fall 2015.",

Chose CMPUT 174 as an optional course with no coding experience before and still got an A+.Sadaf is a FANTASTIC lady wherever in class or in office, she makes the course easy. If you show up to lecture and do the labs, you can get any score you want! CHOOSE HER!",
      "She was really nice. Made herself available the morning of the final for last minute questions which was nice. She cares about her students, often asked me how it was going and when I told her I was struggling, she checked back with me. Attending class is a good idea because she gives hints about exams but perfect attendance not required.",

If you've done any programming before this will probably be one of the easier courses you take in your university career.",
      "Sadaf Ahmed is the most caring, funny, and big hearted professor ever. She really makes sure you understand and is there for you if you don't. She even held out of class help sessions if you wanted extra help. She really takes teaching to the next level and defines what a good teacher is.",

The only problem is that the course is so easy at the start and moves really slow but then all the hard material is pushed till the end, make sure u dont miss any classes for her, missing one class is a lot to catch up on!",

      "Cheat sheets for all of the exams/quizzes, clear voice and slide, and over a week to complete each lab (she released them on Sunday so if your lab was on friday you would have 5 days to do it early and it would not be due for marking until the next lab giving you an extra week). Overall, a pretty easy class for the people who did their work.",

She's really nice and is always willing to answer questions too. Exams can be tricky if you're not careful though",

If you actually write down everything she writes and do the labs before your labs start you will have no problem getting A+. Midterms were easy and final was even easier. Open book midterms and finals made this class fun.",
      "Very helpful and Easy-to-Follow lectures. Fair exams. Highly recommended.",
      "She is just a great prof. She explains the materials very well and uses examples from our daily lives to get it into our heads. Repeats the important things we took in class in every class. Gives out her power point slides. Never used the book. Quizzes are easy but have some trick questions that must have been discussed in the class before.",
      "Sadaf is great!She made the class very easy and fun!It was worth going to her lectures and her slides are helpful.For most of the time I didn't even have to read a txtbook.She's very helpful and nice.If you pay attention in class,it will be very easy to get a good mark;)",
      "Sadaf Ahmed is a wonderful teacher. She is always willing to help and her explanations are very easy to understand. She also has a way of making potentially boring concepts interesting. There is no prior knowledge of math needed and if you attend class and do assigned readings/review lectures you\u2019ll find this class very easy.",
      "Sadaf is an excellent prof and I really liked her",
      "The material is very easy, and she has very unnoticable accent. Her exams are very easy, and she's always helpful. But I would recommend Jones' CMPUT 101 if you can get in before she leaves(summer 2k5).",

      "very easy course to begin with and she furthers this with intense simplification-which can be boring at times. very nice and also helpful. the labs are also an easy component too and i recommend going to them",
      "she goes over concepts to make sure everybody understands and is really nice and helpful. kinda boring lectures tho.",
      "Teacher was helpful and showed concern for students understanding material. A very small accent that was generally easy to understand. A few errors in lecture slides however prevent a perfect score.",

He's always enthusiastic about teaching, very responsive in MyCourses and really cares about his students and he makes sure that the students understand the material and helps them in their assignments He usually gives 4 assignments which are time-consuming but fun and easy to overcome.",
      "Nice fella.",
      "I still don't understand cache at all or anything that was covered in lectures after that yet I still got an A. I might have no deserved it but I think it's awesome generosity! 5 stars just for that",
      "Awesome prof and interesting material in my opinion! He made class fun by sometimes playing short film clips or sounds from movies to introduce the next topic. When it came time to study for the final, it was genuinely fun to study since most of the topics were well explained and still clear in my head.",
      "Fantastic lectures; concepts were explained pretty well. Assignments were tough but at the same time interesting to do. Midterm and final were fair; with proper amount of studying you will ace both of them.",
      "Very inspirational prof and amazing lecture content (recommended for all mathematically oriented computer scientists but not only). Paul was very helpful throughout the course, with assignments but also with extra-curricular issues",
      "Great guy and fun lectures",
      "Very nice professor.",
      "Probably the best/clearest comp sci prof I have taken here at Mcgill. Paul Kry does a great job at demystifying computers. He is a great lecturer and explained everything in a fun and simple way. The assignments are pretty heavy though, really not the type of assignments you can do last minute. I would definitely take another class with him again!",
      "The easiest course of my semester--just keep up with slides, going to the TB if you have to, and show up to the exam. Assignments were really well-written; they were challenging but fun! Would definitely want to take an upper-year course with him. Amazing lecturer/public speaker and actually keeps you engaged during class. All around cool guy!",
      "Best Prof ever. Def want to take a course with him again. &lt;3",
      "One of the best professors at McGill. Very understanding.",
      "No other prof I'd take this course with.",
      "One of my favorite professors yet! You can see that he is passionate about CS and he cares. Really enjoyed 273 with him and hope to take one of his higher-level classes.",
      "One of the best, if not the best, prof in CS. Lectures with genuine enthusiasm and enjoys making references to 80s sci-fi movies. Clear slides, and he really seems to care about his students doing well. (assignments are challenging but reasonable)",
      "Prof Kry is great guy! I am not a fan of the course content, however Paul still makes his lectures interesting. 5.0 quality no doubt!.",
      "Great Prof, its understandable that the course material is hard. Def want to take a course with him in the future.",
      "The structure of the course is very well organized. He comes well prepared and you can tell how much work he puts into his slides. If you want to take a course that teaches you PLENTY, and is lead by someone with a good sense structure take Paul Kry. He did a great job at teaching the course. Assignments are hard, but you will learn a lot.",
      "Is he an amazing professor? Meh maybe. Is he a good professor? Absolutely. He is mentally present when lecturing and not going through the motions of reading slides. He believes you learn by doing and i have to agree with him. I learnt the most by writing assembly code on my own. I would suggest taking him if you have a passion for the subject.",
      "His explanations are very clear. Before taking his class, I thought the way a computer was built was the most boring subject I'll have to learn about in my program, but now it actually became what I love the most and look forward to learning about in the next years. Truly an awesome professor, would take again :) (assignments are kind of hard tho)",

      "Kry's a good professor. I enjoyed going to class at first because of his charisma and enthusiasm toward the material. However, as the semester went on I found his lectures to be increasingly unstructured; reading the textbook was better for learning. Assignments were hard but doable, really helped me understand assembly language &amp; logic more deeply",
      "great prof, very funny, captivating lectures",
      "Really good professor. His lecture makes sense and his slides are clear. He is a humour guy. 4 assignments are hard but interesting, and they are not very helpful to exam. But doing assignment is a good way to understand the circuit and mips. Midterm is fair and average is about 82%. If you review all the slides, A won't be difficult.",
      "The homework was really easy to finish but hard to achieve the first place. Sometimes the first place of an assignment is awarded, so probably you wish to work hard to win the prize. But if you just want an easy A you can skip many classes just like me. And it takes not too long to get bonus points so I consider the prof really merciful.",
      "4 Assignments can be hard, but it's only a matter of time. Truly brilliant professor, although he proceeds quite fast in class that a lot of us might not catch up. It's still easy to read his well prepared ppt to get to know everything u might need in exams. Exams are not challenging as long as you behave actively in class.",
      "Assignments could be time consuming and a pain in the brain, but at least there are only four assignments",
      "Not so difficult, just normal. The assignment are interesting, and the difficult is suitable. If having course recording would be better. By the way, the professor is very patient to answer the questions.",
      "Has a good sense of humor, goes over the material step by step at a steady pace. Lectures are not recorded and age in the afternoon but the slides and suggested readings of textbook are posted on mycourses.",
      "Long assignments but very fair grading scheme",
      "Very fun prof who knows his stuff and teaches well. Would recommend 100%. Might be hard for non comp sci majors?",
      "Truly cares about students' concerns and promptly answers questions on the discussion section of myCourses. Lectures may be a bit confusing for those who haven't learned some jargon, but he goes through many examples in class. And also remember: &quot;what did we do last class?&quot;",
      "He is really nice .. the assignments are kind of time-consuming but they are interesting",
      "Very entertaining prof, does lots of examples in class, brings interesting facts and stories in class (that were usually related to the material). Very helpful when answering questions. Knows the material very well. Definitely the most epic last lecture I've seen in four years at McGill.",
      "Don't expect the class to be easy - COMP273 is complicated and if you don't do well it's not because of the Professor; Prof. Kry makes you work pretty hard and creates all the conditions for you to succeed but you need to really understand all the important stuff the computers are built from.",
      "A great experience all around. Readily available to answer questions and course material presented clearly with strong reinforcement from relevant assignments. Tests and assignments presented fairly and graded in a timely fashion.",
      "Great teacher, but you need to read on your own to fully understand what he explains in class.",
      "He made the class very enjoyable and interesting. Assignments, midterm and final were very fair content and time-wise. Very accessible and always tries his best to answer questions. He really cares and made this class the best one I've had this semester. No other prof I'd rather take this class with!",
      "He's great! Assignments are a little tough, but when you are done you realize they were very fair. Very fun lecturer and will slow down to the pace of the class and wants everyone to understand! Great professor and great class, would take him again!",
      "Prof. Kry is great! Really nice, works hard to make sure you understand the material. Assignments were fair, and shorter than many others I've done in CS at McGill. Definitely agree with the guy who said he's the Bob Ross of CS.",
      "Paul Kry isn't the easiest Prof at McGill, but if you're going into computer science you should probably have expected that. He really cares about his students, and he's pretty funny in lectures, enough to keep the class involved. Paul offers the kind of insight you can't just find on Stack Overflow, take his class and you'll be happy for it.",
      "I thought Prof. Kry did a good job. He really knows the material and the assignments work well to integrate the course material with what he's passionate about. Exams and assignments are marked quite fairly. He does a good job engaging the class during lectures when the material could be a bit dry.",
      "I took this class and literally don't understand the amount of shade he's getting. I never went to class cuz the lectures were recorded, and using just those I was able to get an A- overall. He uses a different approach in lectures, trying to engage the class by interactively working through questions, some use it as an excuse to say he's confusing",
      "This class with Kry is my favourite comp sci course within the program. The assignments were interesting but not hard and he made them worth half the overall grade, so when it came to finals, there was literally no stress. I barely went to class, but I didn't need to cuz all the information I needed, I could extract from the slides.",
      "He's kinda like if Bob Ross taught you Comp Sci. He has an afro too. This course if pretty hard and can get boring, but that's not his fault. He's not THAT good at explaining things but he's alright, and friendly enough to help.",
      "Course material was boring but that's not his fault",
      "Boring class. Just used the textbook",
      "The assignments are pretty great/interesting but take way too long in my opinion. I probably would have done better in this class if I went more often. Also I would have went more if he did more example questions in class cause that's what I really needed tbh. Overall, not that bad. He posts a lot on the discussion boards which is nice.",
      "I don't know what the fuss was with the other reviews. My friends and I found this course kind of dense, but the prof was super clear and the exam was pretty alright too.",
      "Prof Kry is always genuinely passionate in class. This semester a lot of people decided to skip so they might not have done as well since he does great examples on the board. In general the course material does take time to understand, but the assignments were fair and interesting and the final was similarly very fair. He also is very helpful. 5/5!",
      "People are harsh here because this is a hard class. You really have to work for your grade in this class, and that's not all about the prof, its cause it's not easy content. Prof. Kry is clear and very helpful if you ask, he always posts on the discussion boards and answers questions quickly. Make sure you pay attention in class and you'll do fine.",
      "Learnt a lot about graphics and practiced a lot. Prof. always answers questions on discussion board which is very nice and helpful Super smart and good at his field. Awesome sample code. Not easy to understand his lecture(maybe cuz I'm not a native speaker?) But the course is definitely worth taking. You will really learn something.",
      "Very engaging lecturer. He clearly cares a lot about the subject and it shows. Its also fairly obvious that he has a graphics background as he managed to focus some of the assignments on it. The assignments were time consuming but fair and were usually solved for you in the textbook. Highly recommend.",
      "Awesome.",
      "Good teacher. He really knows his stuff and is young and energetic. Be sure to ask questions when things are unclear he has a bad habit of not finishing his sentences."

However, word of advice, show up to all his classes, sit in front, and pay attention. If you slack off and skip you will get on his bad side, and you do not want that.",
      "He's the best lecturer I've ever had, but he plays favorites and generally expects a lot out of his students. His emotional side is great when it comes out in the form of enthusiasm or passion for the subject in class, but unless you're a favorite you won't feel very welcome nor helped if you approach him (how dare you) outside of class.",

      "haven't even had a course with this guy but needed to rate him because he's helped me out before even when he wasnt my prof. once in a tutorial, and once i was looking for my profs office, and mark told me he already left but offered to help me out instead. really nice guy and hes a sens fan too.",

      "Tied with Jit Bose as the best profs I've had so far. Great teaching style; funny guy.",
      "Good prof. He makes great notes and he's funny. His exams really test you so you have to really study. Assignments can be challenging but they're fun.",
      "He is a nice guy and he is good at explaining the concepts behind the stuff he teaches, also he is pretty funny.",
      "He was always funny in class, was able to mix his own humour in with the lectures, definitely knew what he was talking about, kept me interested for the full 90 minutes early in the morning... This year, I got Juan Pablo Zapata, and he is brutal, avoid Zapata his class puts me to sleep, Lanthier has been the best proff I've had at Carleton so far",
      "best prof I've ever had in CS. awesome notes.",
      "I don't even have him for class and I think he's awesome for comp sci. I have his notes for the course i'm taking and they're amazing!",
      "The reason why they keep him teaching first year is because...well, he's the best teacher there is for a student coming in. The best part is that he caters to both people new to programming and experienced programmers. I also recommend doing your honours project with him.",
      "Great professor, easy to understand and follow in his notes (he teaches from them). Amiable, and easy to talk to.",

      "The best Professor for Computer Science. HE has the best notes for his class.",

      "He is an excellent, dynamic lecturer who manages to make the subject matter engaging. The labs and the assignments are long and challenging. Make sure you start working on your assignments well in advance. The midterm was fine, but the final exam was absolutely brutal. Make sure you pay extra attention to the most difficult topics of the course.",
      "Best teacher I've had so far. The lectures are always clear and easy to follow, and he also posts all his notes ahead of time so you can prepare if you want. The homeworks and labs are all useful and really help improve your understanding, and the feedback is always useful. Exams are easy to prepare for, and he has them all posted since like 2002.",
      "I love that teacher.I mean , he gives lots of homework but the harder you work the better it is. Lots of practice and all the information he gives make that course much better to understand and pass.",
      "Great prof, his lectures can be difficult to follow at times, but if you are willing to put the effort in, it is no issue. Labs ans assignments are a fun challenge, nothing too difficult and they really help you master the material taught. He marked and returned our midterm on the same day it was written. really respected!",
      "Best coding professor you can ask for in University. His exams are a bit hard so you have to work for it, thats because he wants to make sure that every student who passes this course actually knows JAVA. Overall hilarious and friendly.",
      "Marcel Turcotte is a hero, a legend and a prodigy. Not only is he an amazing professor but he is a programming legend. Take this mans class to change your life...",
      "Really nice guy and a good professor. Does a good job lecturing, is animated, and takes time to answer questions inside and outside of class. Exams and assignments were all very fair. The subject matter will always be hard for these courses, but when it comes to a prof he's about as good as it gets.",
      "He is a very good prof, knowledgeable and has a sense of humor. If you are looking for a supervisor, he is a good choice. It seems like he knows everything, and he will give you some useful guidance if you ask him questions. Also, he's very kind. Would definitely recommend him!",
      "Very good Prof. , clear explanations in/outside of class. Friendly and very knowledgeable. I had no experience programming in Java, and let me tell you this: go to/ watch his lectures and listen to what he tries to explain, DO YOUR ASSIGNMENTS ON YOUR OWN (a big must) and you will have no problems getting an A in the course, let alone pass it.",
      "really good prof lecture is clear highly recommended !",
      "Good knowledge of the material. He either goes deep into a topic or completely ignores it. Exams were simple",
      "Excellent professor, he explains very well in class but be present. Not tough grader at all and TAs are really good. I did not have any experience in Java prior to that class but after learning Python, it's much easier to get into that object oriented perspective.",
      "If you find it difficult, I suggest to look at online material he offers (previous exams and lecture notes). Other than that, no need to take notes during lectures!",
      "Prof well-paced, clear, very knowledgeable. Walks you through the material. Some assignments are tough, but you get a good amount of time and can work with someone else to complete. Tests may get tricky. If you are new to programming, the course will be challenging and just showing up to class will not be enough. Know your ITI1120 material!",
      "Great prof. No need to take notes, just listen, he teaches in a way that makes all concepts easy to understand. Assignments are very hard, but they're group projects and he gives you TONS of time. If you're good a programming, you can learn the entire course through the assignments. Overall great prof, would take again.",
      "Good professor. Has a decade's worth of old midterms and finals on his website. Assignments can ramble on with a lot of background information but expectations are always listed clearly. Very knowledgeable.",
      "Brilliant professor! He is very knowledgeable and funny.",
      "Very nice professor. Attend his lectures and simply listen to him. You do not need to take any notes, but go over his slides before attempting the assignments (tend to be a little difficult). Prepare yourself for the midterm and final by doing the available past midterms and finals.",
      "Course is much more difficult than ITI 1120.",
      "Good prof, but hard course.",
      "VERY nice prof, clear slides in class, lots of online resourses. I did not take down a single note in his classes, just attend and listen. Do the many available past midterms/exams and you're good.",

      "Belittles students and has a tendency to expect far too much from a class with few months knowledge of programming. Otherwise cares about the students. Most assignments are fair, and exams are fair.",
      "Great Prof, Assignments are tough, his midterm & exam are pretty good though. His Labs are long and usually go the full 3 hours and are extremely boring His lectures aren't bad, people say he picks favourites but he really just picks people that will answer and normally it is the same people but if some one else puts their hand up he will pick them",
      "Assignments are extremely hard, especially the first one. The mandatory labs are long - you won't likely get to finish your work. Marcel is an amazing lecturer. His greatest strength is making concepts very clear.He does pick his favorites.",

He explained abstract concepts in a very academic and simple way which inspired me to attend his lecture and use his notes. He uploaded his lecture notes, and he spent a lot of time in his office hours when I needed help.",
      "He is a perfect professor. As long as he has time and you find him in the office, he will do everything to help his students even it's not his scheduled office hour.",
      "Assignments and midterms are easy. The final tho, is very very hard. He is nice tho and he scales up the class.",
      "Good lecture notes. Audio notes are available too. There're sample tests online and quite similar to the midterm. He gives you solutions for assignments which is great. Overall he's a good decent prof in CS. The course is hard though but all CMPT courses are hard you know what I mean.",
      "Easy assignments and midterms. But the final is crazy hard. He explains the course material pretty clearly though.",
      "It's a very hard course, but Tony realizes this and does his best to help every student get a good grade. Many profs at SFU pride themselves in making it difficult to get a good grade, but not this prof - he puts many sample exams online to practice on (and the exams are usually very similar) - he makes audio recordings available and all notes too.",
      "Keys to be successful in this course: 1)find a good group mate 2)read the all the notes(every single line) that he posted online! 3)must understand each assignment in order to pass this course",
      "Nice prof and ok explaining skills it's just that the course material is pretty hard. Don't worry his midterms are worth only 10% of total grade while assignments worth 7.5% each(4 assignments in total). He also allows you to replace lab attendance for any assignments u miss.",
      "Best prof ever! But his assignments were tough !",
      "Very friendly and helpful instructor. The difficulty of this course heavily depends on whether or not you regularly go to his office. He posts online notes and audio recordings of each lecture. Tests are hard but not unreasonable. Assignments are easy if you start them early and attend to labs. Everything in the course is well organized.",

Textbook is not necessary with him, he even posts notes at the end of the week with everything you need to know. Assignments were fun and exams weren't hard if you just pay attention to lecture.",
      "One of the best profs in SFU computing science. I took both cmpt 150 and 250 with him. Exams are a little bit hard, but if you attend the lectures and able to do his assignments you will find no difficulties. Over all superb, but grading is little bit harsh.",

Textbook is not needed at all, just make sure to attend every lecture and copy down everything he writes. Assignments and tests are not easy but they are fair so study hard and put in a good amount of effort. Definitely recommend taking his courses.",

The notes do NOT adequetely prepare you for the asns and exams, and they look MUCH harder(although they should NOT). You need to SELF STUDY a lot, and it'll cost you BIG TIME if you are too busy w/ MACM!",

He is always glad to help and never let students to be disappointed. He posts his neatly prepared lecture notes on the website. He is really a gret SENIOR LECTURER as his title specifies.",
      "Very good prof. He might be a bit monotone lecturing but he's very organized, and does a excellent job presenting complex info in a clear manner. You learn a lot in his class.
