Great job - if there would be more teachers like Mr. Sahami, world would be much nicer place...",

      "I stumbled upon the CS106A lectures on iTunes U and found that professor Mehran Sahami really teaches brilliantly! His clear, structured, uncluttered explanations, and the very apt examples are a huge help in understanding and retaining the concepts in ones mind. I loved the lectures and learnt a lot.

      "What a nut. He's awesome.",
      "Baller.",
      "This guy was freakin amazing. If you've got to take CS106A and you're not too keen on it, you should definitely take it from Mehran. Seriously. He even passes out candy in class, so you can't go wrong by going to lecture.",
      "All my friends raved about how great he was, but I just didn't think he was that funny. Attending lecture was certainly not necessary.",
      "Awesome CS teacher who makes everything clear, and wears costumes and funny vocabulary to boot. He works for Google and if you go to one of his Google talks he just may give you a free Google flashlight keychain.",

Heck, I didn't even want to do programming before I came, but after 15-112 I am considering double majoring or minoring in CS alongside ECE. Take advantage of this class and learn as much as you can.",

The basis of a flipped classroom is that it offers class time to reinforce material, and that has not happened as much as I would have hoped so far.

Professor Kosbie challenges you to excel not only as a programmer, but as a human being. His passion for living is infectious. By the end of this course, you will emerge with a new view on life beyond academia.",

However it is fun, so I rather do the homework for this class than for any other class. Honestly this is my favorite class that I have ever taken. Prof. Kosbie wants you to work hard, but definitely not to overreach.",

Instead of giving me helpful feedback, he just shamed me for having social anxiety, and I can't see him the same way again. I hope I never have to take one of his classes again.",
      "David Kosbie is hands down the greatest teacher I have had in my entire education. 15-115 -- Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science -- has been the most rewarding, enriching, inspirational, character building, and difficult course i've taken in my life. If my entire time at CMU was to take this course, it will have been worth it.",
      "hes awesome",
      "The most helpful professor imaginable. Makes everything about the class interesting.",
      "He is not even a good CS professor. He is just simply the best.",
      "He is the BEST professor I've ever met. I enjoyed every moment in his class! I even want to fail the class and take it again! Just TOO MUCH FUN!",
      "Incredible professor, incredible person. 15-112 is a very difficult course but having such a great professor makes it very manageable. He not only knows his subject inside and out, but he is 100% committed to helping students succeed and is very helpful for students who seek his assistance. Highly recommended.",
      "Kosbie is an amazing guy. I went in with a bit of background in programming (not python though) and still got whacked HARD. He will drive you really hard, but he'll offer you all the resources available to make sure you make it through - only if you work for it. The defining course in my CMU education so far... Carpe Diem!",
      "Took this class a few years ago. Kosbie is a good teacher who shows his passion for CS. His class is hard relative to other sections but this is good preparation for upper level classes which can get very difficult.",
      "Best professor ever! Entertaining, an amazing lecturer, and passionate about the students' learning.",
      "Kosbie's awesome! You learn tons in his class. He does go reasonably fast and also talks about life, but it's all worth it; you learn so much in his class! Just make sure you're on top of things, and don't fall asleep in class!",
      "By far the best professor I have this semester! The class will kick you in the butt, but Kosbie is such a great teacher it's all worth it. Taking advantage of his and the CAs availability makes learning all the programming feasible and decently fun. Carpe diem!!",
      "Reasonable amount of work, but he does not go over material very thoroughly in class. Class notes are not all that helpful",
      "THE BEST PROFESSOR! If you pay attention in class, you will learn A LOT! All necessary notes are online. Is willing to do anything for his students and will stay at office hours until EVERY student is fully helped. I took his class a year and a half ago, but he still asks me how I am doing. Students are Professor Kosbie's top priority.",
      "This class is simply amazing. Kosbie is a great professor and passionate teacher. He will make sure that each student is coping and keeping up good work with the course material. he fuels imagination and teaches not only CS, but also about life. A must take course in CMU. Carpe Diem!",
      "Take 112 if you can. It's one of those courses you're missing out on if you don't. Kosbie is a fantastic lecturer and a reasonable person. But, NEVER BE LATE TO A MEETING WITH HIM. EVER.",
      "Kosbie is awesome. The course demands a great deal of hard work, but it's ultimately very, very, very rewarding. I learned so much in such a small span of time.",
      "Kosbie is by far the most passionate, dedicated, helpful and amazing person I've come across. Expect a lot of work, but don't fret because there's more help than you can imagine. I wish he taught all my future CS courses! Also, he's super-accessible and does everything he can to make sure we do well. Carpe Diem!!",
      "You want this man as your professor! He taught me so much about programming in one semester, yet I learned more about life than I had in the 18 years previous. He will accept nothing but your best, but don't let that scare you. Consider it a breath of fresh air. TAKE THIS CLASS. (Oh, and dont sleep in class). Carpe Diem Kosbie! 42",
      "Oops meant to choose 5s.Kosbie is the best. He is SO good at teaching, so clear in explaining, so invested in the course, so passionate about programming and even just about living life in general, so approachable and accessible outside of class, so wonderful, so amazing... oh man I wish he would teach all the rest of my future programming courses.",
      "&quot;If you do everything Kosbie tells you to do, you will be a genius&quot;: John Mackey. Can't say it better myself. Amazing professor who gives 110% to his class. He will inspire you to do things you never thought possible. Lots of work involved (expect 20+ hours weekly), but Kosbie provides so much suppor that nothing is impossible. Take this class.",
      "Amazing professor, in all regards. The class difficulty and homework levels take some time to get used to straight out of high school, but you can tell Kosbie really wants you to do well. I struggled during the year, but he was willing to sit down and help me out, even with nonCS stuff. Definitely take this class.",
      "Awesome person!!",
      "Amazing teacher. Really has the passion for everyone to do well if they put in the effort. Class definitely kicks your butt. Stay on top of it, couldn't have done it without Kosbie. He definitely keeps you awake in class.",
      "You want this man as your teacher.",
      "David Kosbie is inspiring, amazing, challenging, and so much more. He's not just a professor, he's a mentor, and he teaches his students so much about life. For lecture in range(len(course)), there were hundreds of stories. I'm blessed to have been able to take his class. A most rewarding experience for any freshman--you won't regret it.",
      "He is simply incredible. His explanations of complex ideas to complete n00bs are astounding in their simplicity and effectiveness. He assigns a LOT of work, but it is all helpful and even fun. He has an excellent rapport with the class and has time for each and every student.",
      "He is amazing, I wish he taught my math class. He used to be a high school teacher so he relates very well. Very eccentric and amusing. DO NOT FALL ASLEEP IN HIS CLASS!",
      "He is amazing, I wish he taught my math class. He used to be a high school teacher so he relates very well. Very eccentric and amusing. DO NOT FALL ASLEEP IN HIS CLASS!",
      "I've only been in his class for two weeks and have fallen in love with the material. His passion for programming and computer science resonates through the room each time he gives a lecture. It is not an easy class but Kosbie is very helpful. Carpe diem Kosbie, you're an integral member of the CMU community. Keep up the good work!",
      "He's fantastic!",
      "An amazing teacher. He's passionate about programming. He tries to make it fun and interesting challenging those who need a challenge and reaching out to help those in neef. The class is entirely doable if you have some motivation. The homework can be a little time consuming and challenging. Same with the midterms. The final is easy.",
      "This man gives Introduction to programming a heart. I would recommend everybody to take his class. He demands much effort, but is extremely serious in making sure you get it.",
      "Kosbie is a good professor who's passionate about his work and gives clear explanations of every concept covered. However, his lectures go beyond the scope of the course and his homework requires a lot of time. His midterm exams are relatively easy if you understand the material, and his final exam is extremely easy if you've survived the semester.",
      "Kosbie teaches through experience He does indeed give some intense homeworks that demand 20+ hours of work a week, but in the end the assignments become 2nd nature. Also, he's always there to give the whizz kids challenging problems and is always there for the those struggling to keep up. Always accessible and has tons of well trained TA's.",
      "If you're interested in programming go for Kosbie. There's no one better at explaining and he's by far one of the most helpful and accessible profs here at CMU. But he does give more homework than the other professors and he covers more material so be ready. For those taking this class for &quot;fun&quot; should probably reconsider taking his lecture.",
      "I personally had zero programming experience and was nervous about the subject. But now that the course is wrapping up, I can honestly say that I know how to program. Always entertaining. Good teacher.",
      "Great Prof, but his class is really difficult for people who don't know any programming. In my opinion he is only suitable for CS students, other students should try to avoid him.",
      "Excellent teacher, yet difficult homework. Expect to spend a lot of time doing work, but his lectures are fun and make sense. Once you finish this class, I guarantee you will know a lot about programming and will be ready for 111. One of, if not the best 15100 programming teacher.",
      "Good teacher and very passionate. What he teaches goes way beyond the scope of the course, but teaches the information well. Tough and tedious HW but you WILL learn a lot in this class! -15100"

He is a hard test maker, but if you study you will be fine because the overall course grading makes up for the hard tests. Pro-tip: Do homework and projects in Office Hours. The course webpage makes it easy to stay on top of work.",
      "The lectures are easy to understand. The homework and projects are designed to be difficult but give you great practice. There are extra questions that are usually much harder than the regular homework, and I would highly suggest you at least attempt them. The tests are difficult, but extremely consistent, so doing practice tests helps immensely.",

      "John is one of the best professors here at Berkeley. Everyone knows he's an accomplished computer scientist (he created Google Translate) but he remains very humble and makes CS understandable for all. If you want to learn a lot take DeNero. The class is challenging and moves extremely fast but the resources are there to help you succeed!",
      "Great professor, his passion for CS really shone in 61A. Exams can be tricky at times but with practice(especially on past exams) you will get better at solving his exams problems. He is also very helpful during office hours, and he makes sure there are a lot of resources available for you to succeed.",
      "This is a great Prof I met during my university life. He is talent, caring and inspirational. I love computer science since I attended his class.",
      "His lectures are great, and I actually looked forward to the homework and projects.",
      "Awesome professor. His lectures were clear, and he's really good at answering our questions. Gave us life advice at the end of the semester too. Should be easy to get full credit on hw/projects if you start early and make use of piazza and OH. Tests can be tricky, so make sure to do a bunch of practice exams. Grading is pretty fair.",
      "Loved taking CS61A. I didn't attend lectures, just watched the online lectures. The class is pretty fair and they give opportunities for EC - definitely do the EC! I learned a lot and there is lots of support. At the time of writing final grades haven't been given out, but I'm an A-/A.",
      "Daddy. Very clear lectures and very helpful when stuck. the core course material does not really prepare you for the tests on their own though so significant practice and work outside the hw and projects are needed but otherwise very good course taught by a very good teacher.",
      "I took Data 8 with Denero and Wagner Fall 2017 and it is so clear how much effort they put into crafting a really interesting and well-designed class. Denero is charismatic and moves at a good pace in his lectures. He mostly taught the coding portion of the material and was very approachable when I asked questions in office hours.",
      "John DeNero is a legend for a reason. The man truly has a gift for lecturing, explaining concepts very clearly and in an amusing fashion. The content of 61A is very interesting, and the assignments are designed to get you thinking about computer science in a new way. Loved the class, loved the professor.",
      "Prof. DeNero is witty, knowledgable, and patient. He and the GSIs construct an inclusive, helpful environment for all students. There is no shortage of help (Piazza, office hours, lab), though you may have to wait during busy times, like right before a project is due. Try to take coding problems in stride. You learn best through trial and error!",
      "Lots of resources to help you succeed. Clearly outlines the material and lectures are easy to follow. Useful if you have prior programming experience. The midterms and final are fair. They mainly test problem solving abilities. Denero is extremely friendly and willing to help. Some of the projects are a bit awful. HW and labs are generally easy.",
      "The myth, the man, and the legend. This guy somehow manages to simulate a semi-personal connection with each and every student in a class with several hundred students. The course (for the most part) was very well run, and I definitely enjoyed it. He and Adhikari both did an amazing job trying to make the material accessible for everyone.",
      "He's overall a really good teacher. He explains everything relatively well considering it's a pretty intense programming course. The projects weren't too bad as they were just based off completion. Just be prepared for really difficult exams; it's what wrecked my grade in the end.",
      "Professor DeNero is the man, I have never had a professor this good.",
      "Take his class. I mean it. Denero changed my view of computer science forever. He matches his ridiculous intellect with kindness and understanding towards his students, and to top it off he genuinely wants everyone in his class to succeed. Put in the work and you'll do just fine.",
      "Very nice professor.",
      "DeNero is the most enthusiastic and definitely the best professor I've ever known. It's very obvious he has put more efforts into teaching this course than most other professors, and he did a great job in getting his students excited about computer science.",
      "His lectures are so great that the online textbook is unnecessary. However, get ready to work plenty if you want to do well. If you can complete all homework and projects on time, you can get 100% on those assignments and even some extra credit, so the only thing in the way are the exams. Be sure to understand the concepts and you'll do fine.",
      "If you can take this class, do it",
      "Overall I liked him but the tests and projects are annoying. They are fill in the blank instead of coding something from scratch. His lectures are good but sometimes I feel like he goes really in depth in order to distinguish people on tests instead of teaching more useful material. Look at last problem on MT2 F2016. Study more than hw and labs.",
      "Great lecturer, funny, informative, his style makes everyone laugh. Might be tricky to catch in office hours; his office gets pretty crowded.",
      "This class affirmed my decision to pursue CS! I loved DeNero's lectures and enjoyed doing the homeworks and projects. The class was an interesting experience, though I'll warn that it is fast-paced.",
      "One of the best teachers I've ever had - a great lecturer, accessible via office hours or email, well-paced syllabus, and funny to boot. Would highly recommend taking a class with him!",
      "Know that CS61A will likely become your 1st priority unless taken P/NP. It's time-consuming & just plain hard for people without programming experience (expect 20+ hrs/wk), but doable and very interesting, and his lectures and course design are what make it work. So don't take it with another hard and unrelated class. Like an MCB upperdiv. haha fml",
      "It is possible to do well in this class. Professor DeNero is a great teacher and he provides the resources to succeed in his class, you just have to work hard and study. It is pretty helpful to have prior programming experience, but if you put in the work, you don't have to. Great class and great professor.",
      "The class is very well-organized, but it covers a lot of content (prior programming experience is almost necessary). Also, exams are require you to think outside the box and test things that you may not have thought of. Professor DeNero is very knowledgeable, explains difficult concepts well, is an engaging lecturer, and makes a large class work.",
      "Not as good as hug but still a great CS prof",
      "Professor DeNero is incredibly friendly, accessible and inspirational. Even though his course will make you work reasonably hard, if you put in the time and effort, you can get a high score on his exams.",
      "John DeNero is a great lecturer and teacher. He explains things clearly, with the occasional joke. The midterms are hard.",
      "Such an amazing professor, I love his class even though it's pretty challenging for me. Provides a ton of support and the projects are super fun! He's also a funny guy and gis lectures aren't boring at all, so that's a plus!",
      "Definitely the best teacher I've had at Cal. He was organized, entertaining, and obviously cares a lot about his students. His class was a blast and made me want to be a CS major.",
      "Great professor. The class isn't an easy A and the exams do require a great deal of studying, but you learn a lot from the course.",
      "He's great at making the class interesting and really trying to spark the interests of his students. He also genuinely cares about each individual student despite having more than 1000 to deal with. His lectures are informative as well as funny, and he doesn't overload you with work. It's a hard class, but he tries to get you the support you need.",
      "He is AMAZING! Everything you could want in a professor :) Him and his army of TAs really made this 1400-person class work.",
      "Simply Amazing. Funny. Clear. Tall. The class starts out very easy but picks up waaay too fast and the second midterm and final killed me.",
      "Amazing professor, cannot be easy to teach a class of this size, and you won't get any face time with Denero. Nonetheless, you come out of this class, changed.",
      "Legend. Immortal. Amazing. God. Life-changer. Even if you end up failing the class, you won't regret taking CS61A. Why? Because of DeNero. He's a gem. Seeing him outside is like seeing a celebrity. I hope he keeps on teaching CS61A.",
      "DeNero is a great professor! He makes a conscious effort to make sure students are succeeding in his classes. He is super willing to help and will help student with trivial problems like internet connection issues. He makes what would be an impossible course simply difficult. Would recommend 61A to students from all majors, definitely memorable!",
      "One of the best cs professors you could take at Berkeley. I don't enjoy programming, but his enthusiasm for the subject makes this class fun and interesting. He's also understanding of the fact that this is a hard class with a heavy course load. He doesn't like seeing students do poorly and he'll help you if you ask for it.",
      "DeNero is to this day the most inspirational and wonderful lecturer whose class I have had the privilege of experiencing. He is so understanding and helpful. 10/10 recommend any class with him.",
      "DeNero really works for his students, and is one of the best lecturers I've ever seen.",
      "Awesome class, nicely structured, and very organized. He's got an amazing sense of humor and you can tell he really cares about the subject. Compsci is not an easy topic (Berkeley CS is a hard dose of reality for a lot of normally good students) but you will walk away learning something.",
      "DeNero is one of the most amazing professors ever! He's really good at explaining difficult material. I came in to this class with no previous coding experience and since the class was very hard I constantly thought about dropping, but I stayed because of DeNero. He and the course staff work really hard to provide resources for struggling students.",
      "Denero is an absolute gem. This is my first time coding and I am having so much fun with it because his lectures are amazing and the assignments are incredibly well-crafted. He is the best teacher I have ever had",
      "Heaven on a Professor.",
      "Best professor for intro CS. Could be the best professor I've ever had. I became a TA for this class in large part due to him personally. If you're here you probably are already planning to take this class, but if you're not sure yet: take this class. One note: go to his office hours. For a 1000 student class, they're somehow always empty.",
      "CS61A was an incredible class. There were over 900 people enrolled, but I had more opportunities for personal assistance than in any of my smaller classes. John is an awesome professor - fun, interesting, and helpful. His online videos are very clear and precise (more so than any professor's physical lectures). Definitely would recommend.",
      "Best person you could ask for your first CS class at Cal. Expect to spend a lot of time on projects and homework and studying for tests, but GO TO OFFICE HOURS. The TAs are very helpful, remember that you're not alone on this. I've gone to every lecture, you can watch the videos online but live lectures are great. Hilarious and answers questions",
      "Bruh this dude more fire than my mixtape.",
      "There are 3 times in life I felt so bad about losing someone. The first time is when my ex-girlfriend left me and went to another city. Second is when I stepped into the airport after visiting a good friend who I couldn't see for years . Third time is on Prof. John DeNero's last lecture.",
      "John really cares about his students. Teaching the biggest class on campus, he really makes an effort to make sure each individual gets the attention they need. He is a great lecturer and he tells you NOT to come to lecture and to just watch the webcasts. Amazing. Perfect guy for students' first CS prof when they come to Berkeley.",
      "I've never rated a professor before, but, like Yeezus, this man is a god.",
      "Simply amazing.",
      "OMG He is my fav prof. I believe everyone who has taken cs61a with him would LOVE computer science.",
      "Great professor. Great class. Take it.",
      "Denero is an amazing professor. His online video lectures are far better than live lecture. However, learning in this class really comes from surviving the constant inundation of homework, quizzes and projects. Doing previous exams are essential for success on his exams.",
      "I felt blessed to have taken this course. I barely had any programming experience before and DeNero simply guided me through. His webcast lecture was probably the clearest I have ever seen. Homework and Discussion handout were helpful. The first midterm was fair but the second midterm kind of shocked us all but he was quick to react and adjust.",
      "Homework is graded based on effort, Labs and Discussions are only worth points if you are literally killed by the test, and tests can be hard. DeNero is ridiculously smart and a great lecturer and I enjoyed the class. Put in the time (DO THE DISCUSSIONS) and you won't be sorry.",
      "Denero is amazing. His lectures are very helpful and he keeps them interesting and fun. Lectures are most commonly viewed online, which is also helpful. You'll definitely learn a lot in this class and help is readily available via office hours and online resources. On the other hand, the work load for this class is large that the exams are tough.",
      "John Denero is fantastic. He is loved by students. His (massive) course is extremely well organized. Most of his homework and projects are useful. Lecture videos are posted online, and are very good. Biggest downside is that it's a hard course. I came in with a lot of prior experience and did fine, but I still had to study and practice quite a bit",
      "CS 61A is a difficult class, but professor Denero's humor and enthusiasm made it much bearable. He is an inspiring lecturer and you can tell he really cares about his students.",
      "DeNero is a great teacher for 61A. It was a fun class and he taught us python well. Didn't like Logic but he made python a joy to learn.",
      "Best teacher ever! I went into the course without any programming experience and so far he's made the material extremely accessible. He's a super nice and chill guy as well, go check out his office hours and hang out with him, or if you have questions about NLP or even industry vs academia, DeNero is your guy",
      "John DeNero was incredibly clear, and he was a fantastic lecturer, especially considering that over 900 students took CS61A in Fall 2013. All of the lectures were filmed in advance, so it was not even necessary to go to lecture. He genuinely cares about all of his students. However, the class itself is quite challenging.",
      "Fantastic online presentation, fantastic lecturer, has WONDERFUL TAs, really know howto organize and present concepts and got me into coding! I'm really glad my major requires this class, and am grateful to have taken this class and learned so much from him! That said, no programming experience makes this class very painful, especially projects.",
      "DeNero is an awesome lecturer and really makes all the content easy to read and understand. But don't think you can just skip lectures and not study.",
      "John Denero's lectures, materials, and assignments, and course as a whole could be best described as an unparalleled masterwork of education. Simply put, this guy can turn any willing human being into a computer scientist. Flawless educator.",
      "John explains everything in a way that the course material just clicked in place. Came in with negligible programming experience and ended up with an A+ in this class. He gives lots of chances to pass this class and earn points (including extra credit). Favorite class ever!",
      "Fantastic class and great professor! Very clear and organized. I think the best part about this class is even though it is formally an intro course, even experienced programmers will learn and find his class interesting by focusing on the programming mindset and problem solving skills necessary to be successful in CS. Strongly recommend this class!",
      "Phenomenal teacher--lecture is clear, tests are challenging but not impossible, class is super-structured and organized, and it's obvious he enjoys what he does",
      "John is a God! Great teacher and so passionate! One of the clearest lecturers ever! Loves Computer Science and you can tell he loves to teach. Projects and homework are doable. Very hard class(tests especially) if you're knew to coding but hard work pays off...",
      "Great professor, very articulate. And nice guy as well!",
      "Best Professor I've Ever Had, and will always be one of the greatest.",
      "One of the best professors I've had at Cal, and the reason I'm majoring in CS. Even with 1000 students, he found a way to make it work.",
      "Brilliant teacher. Really knows what he is talking about. Lectures are funny and very informative. Homework and projects are challenging but so worth it. Hands down, one of the best teachers I've seen. Ever."

      "Dan is a wonderful professor. Very caring and enthusiastic. He motivates his students and grades fairly. He made my first cs class a great experience.",
      "Dan Garcia is an extremely inspiring professor who goes out of his way to motivate struggling students and give them chances to recover. He implemented the ability to clobber earlier midterm scores with a higher final exam score, made exams very familiar to what he taught in lecture, and shifted grade bins downward to boost peoples final grades.",
      "I love Dan Garcia. He is a professor that truly care about his students and trying to provide as many as opportunities for his students in his CS61A community. At Berkeley EECS department, they strive to prevent students from declaring CS, but Dan is the one that truly love his students and help his students getting into this major. LoveDan loveCS",
      "This is a professor that truly cares about students. He not only inspire everyone in his class but he also give good grades. He is also very very passionate during lecture and you can see that he really love cs.",
      "Professor Garcia's an incredible CS educator whose care for students shines through his fun lectures and pro-student course policies. While the content for CS61A is highly standardized, Dan's enthusiasm made a difference in getting through this tough course.",
      "Dan is a great professor. Very enthusiastic every single day. His love for CS is truly inspiring. He's very funny and although 61a is very very tough, having him made lectures something I looked forward to.",
      "Dan is an amazing professor who is extremely enthusiastic and quirky. He introduced several course policies to 61A that were really beneficial to students. Although he's great at explaining concepts, his time management is not the best so lecture material is not always covered very well. Lectures also often have a lot of tangents and fluff.",
      "Amazing professor, very passionate, explains things well.",
      "Amazing professor!!",
      "Amazing Professor!",
      "TAKE CS10! If you don't know anythign about programming before coming to Cal, I highly recommend taking CS10(in the fall of freshman year if you can). You might just reconsider your whole life(or at least major). Dan is just awesome and the class is easy. You can learn a lot if you put in effort, I've can wade into the world of Python on my own now",
      "I knew nothing about CS when I came to Berkeley, and CS10 made me fall in love with programming. Dan is great, truly cares about his students, and is big on making CS accessible for all. Contrary to some students' beliefs that CS10 is a &quot;joke&quot; class, I truly felt I learned a lot and it prepared me well for success in CS61a and CS61b.",
      "Dan Garcia is a great professor and I enjoyed taking CS10 with him. However, CS10 itself is a waste of time. You only start doing Python in the last 3 weeks of the semester and spend the rest of the time working in a language called Snap. If you are a complete novice when it comes to computers then CS10 is for you. Else, save time and just take 61A",
      "Dan is a great lecturer and nice guy. He goes out of his way to make sure as many students enjoy, learn from, and pass his class. He's also exceedingly funny and open in office hours, he and the GSI's are always around to help out. Few tests, plenty of resources to study given, plenty of feedback and extra credit opportunities.",
      "Dan is the absolute best. He cares more than any professor I've ever had. He was integral in the creation of this class. Lectures are more big picture, lab is where you learn, and there is a ton of extra credit if you still aren't doing so hot.",
      "Most enthusiastic professor ever who made me fall in love with CS. Take CS10 if you're even remotely considering studying CS. Go to his lectures and office hours for sure he goes over exam problems and it's a great opportunity to get to know him. Bottomline: Dan's great!!",
      "Dan Garcia is AMAZING! CS10 is honestly one of the best classes you can take: you will learn a lot, especially from lectures. The class has a nice pace and you never have to worry about your grade, because there is so much extra credit and opportunities to prove that you learned. Overall an amazing professor and I would recommend 100%!",
      "CS 10 has completely changed my view on computing and programming. Dan is energetic and bound to broaden your horizon. Highly recommend.",
      "funny, makes the subject very interesting.",
      "Absolutely amazing lecturer, one of my favorites at Cal. I took more computer science than I had planned here just to attend another class with him. He has some great insights on computer science and can really broaden your horizons. I know his technical classes are harder, but CS10 with Garcia is definitely a class I would recommend to anyone.",
      "One of the best lecturers at Berkeley and probably in the world.",
      "His lectures were very engaging and he always brought in interesting guest lecturers! He is very passionate and excited and friendly, and his exams are very fair. Great experience!!",
      "This guy is amazing for CS10. He will get you to love computer science, I promise.",
      "Dan is the most fun professor I've ever had. He is very engaged, clearly cares about his students, and realizes that most of us are taking more than just his class. Reasonable homework and projects - you need to know your stuff, but in the end it's totally doable. After 61b with Hilfinger it's pretty easy.",
      "MY FAVORITE <3 he is a great and engaging lecturer.",
      "This class is great, in my opinion. There were many things to do in the class, but it (almost) always felt satisfying and fun. On top of that, you can learn topics like recursion and higher order functions in a safe environment before going on to harder classes like CS61A.",
      "I had no CS background so it was NOT an easy class for me. Tons of work. But he's an awesome professor and so organized! EVERYTHING was online. He cares about students more than any professor I've had. The grading policies helped a lot\u2014 I freaked out when I got a D on the first exam but I still got an A in the class. He's fair.",
      "while this is definitely a hard class if you're mathematically challenged, it's helpful if you intend to work on the internet or work with computers. It's also a great way to learn about computer's place in our life and the evolution of technology",
      "Professor Garcia is EXTREMELY enthusiastic about Computer Science, which was encouraging. The class was a lot of work and rather time-consuming, but I had a lot of fun with it. It's a great class for students with no programming experience that just want to try it out. I would definitely recommend this class!",
      "Awesome professors, super enthusiastic about computer science.",
      "Professor Garcia made me LOVE programming and even switching from a chemical engineering major to computer science! This class is a lot of fun, and I learned a lot. Even non-majors should take this, though it definitely is the TAs who are the most helpful, due to being there in labs and discussion for help with projects.",
      "Take CS 10 with Dan Garcia! It introduces computing to everyone, even people like me who have no prior CS experience. Lectures were a mix of social aspects (internet privacy issues, etc) and lab concepts (recursion, higher-order functions). It helps to have an analytical or math-ie mind, but if that's not your strong point no worries--Dan's amazing",
      "this review was from wen the class was 1st taught: most enthusiastic professor ive had! hes always willing to help too. however his exams are WAY too complex compared to what we did in lab/projects/hw. wen the mean for the exams is an F, you know you're not preparing students as well as you should be. otherwise AMAZING class. recommend to all!",
      "One of the most enthusiastic and fair teachers at UCB, tries to make lectures as entertaining as possible and is very responsive to the class as a whole.",
      "He is an excellent teacher. I had no problems with him. However, I'm just not a computer science kind of guy, so I had a hard time with this class. Expect to stay up quite late at night doing the projects. GET STARTED ON THEM IMMEDIATELY. I can't stress that enough haha. Also, MAKE SURE YOU GET THE CONCEPTS. The final is KILLER so be prepared.",
      "Garcia is very into CS - his energy makes lecture worthwhile. Final was difficult compared to midterm. Class itself wasn't particularly hard and Dan is very friendly and easy to relate to. I'd say he is a great guy.",
      "Good lecturer, tests aren't too bad it you're fairly intelligent. Had an overall good experience with him.",
      "This prof is outstanding. Best lecturer I've ever had, by far. Also, the class itself is amazing. Tons of very interesting material is covered. The only negative: as in every lower-div CS class I've taken, the project grades rely heavily on the autograders, leading to low grades for minor mistakes. Otherwise perfect!",
      "CS61C with Dan Garcia is certainly a fully packed learning experience. A lot of material is covered and the exams are not trivial. However, I also got an A with little studying aside from the final; skip buying the textbooks as the lecture PowerPoints are very sufficient. All in all, good course, recommended.",
      "Good lectures, interesting personality, and shows CG clips before class. Like most CS classes, projects take some time. The midterm is challenging, but doable. There is a nice policy where you can overwrite your midterm grade if you do well on the final."

I suggest you read &quot;Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution&quot; if you want interesting trivia. He shows up around page 110. Take this class. It's great!",
      "I can not imagine a better professor than Brian Harvey. His lectures are great if you are truly interested in computer science, and he is the only professor I have ever had that has been able to answer every single question asked in a clear and coherent way.",
      "I highly recommend taking CS10 with Brian Harvey. He and Dan Garcia did a great job with that class -- Brian's lectures may seem monotonous but the material is so interesting. He has a lot of great insights into the social aspects of computing. I learned a lot and I'm glad I took the course. Looking forward to 61A with him next semester.",
      "He has been teaching this class for years, and it shows. Great class and well taught. Lectures can be a bit dry at times, but they are usually interesting if you like the subject. Class is not easy, but the tests and the grading is extremely fair. I was lucky enough to have a great TA too.",
      "this review is from when this course was first taught, so it may be different now: he didnt do that many lectures, but he was very knowledgeable, although a little boring. not the most exciting lecturer, but he had some good ways of explaining things, and love the beatles references.tests were mostly made by garcia, but his questions werent too bad",
      "Great guy, taught me so much in lecture. He even has a great personality, very approachable. great teacher to have build one's basic and fundamental knowledge in comp sci.",
      "A brilliant professor who has taught the class for so long that he really knows what he's talking about. Lectures are very clear and direct, but on the boring side, as well as not mandatory (webcasted). Tests and concepts were difficult, but grading system is very fair.",
      "His teaching style is very clear and he explains things fairly well. Personally I found his lectures to be interesting but many others I know find them to be boring, so it really depends from person to person. His sense of humor and frequent Beatles references are also nice.",
      "Clear but boring lectures. Discussions fairly helpful, though at times they covered problems that were too confusing/hard. Homeworks and projects were well-made, mostly being recycled from past semesters. Tests were fair and well-written.",
      "Homework was graded on effort, so even if you can't do it all you still get points. Projects weren't too hard. Midterms were always dicey, but fair. Past midterms help a lot. LAB and DIS were very helpful. Class was hard because it's very easy to lose a letter grade from stupid mistakes. Scheme is a good language to learn with though.",
      "Great professor, very interesting class. He's a little jaded from teaching it for so long. Also, he gave an extremely hard final and refused to curve it; only 23 percent got A's as opposed to other years (35 %). Average on final was a D-.",
      "A great class and a great professor. I don't know why so many people are saying it's hard. I know someone with no programming experience whatsoever who got an A+ in this class. And not time-consuming at all (for a CS course). Best CS class in the world.",
      "The class is difficult because it covers a lot of concepts, but Harvey explains everything clearly and gives you all his notes. The class is really polished since he's been teaching it for so long. Exams are fair if you study. No curve. The projects aren't extremely difficult, just time consuming. He's a nice guy. Other professors should model him.",
      "He is an okay lecturer, can be really dry sometimes. I found the midterms to be somewhat crazy though. I hated the class to begin with, and found it pretty hard. But he himself is not that bad of a teacher, and if you are good at comp sci this class should be fairly easy. RECURSION IS A MUST KNOW!",
      "Great professor, explains everything well, and the class is really fun. (That's probably why he's pretty much the only professor who teaches the class. But it's a BAD IDEA to take the class without previous experience (AP Comp. Sci., CS3, etc.). There's no curve, just extra points added sometimes if midterm scores were really low.",
      "Great professor, explains everything very well, answers all questions, and is very approachable. Class can get hard at times, but never too bad. Tests and assignments are fair. I recommend having prior programming experience before taking this class, or take CS 3 first.",
      "Great professor, great lecturer, and very nice guy. He will make sure to answer all question during lecture before continuing. The class itself wasn't too hard, but you HAVE to think like a programmer. Prior programming RECOMMENDED! The midterms are certainly fair as long as you take the time to look at the practice midterms in the reader.",
      "For most of the class' ideas, his explanations were extremely clear, making it not necessary to go to office hours.",
      "His class is very structured and he provides you with great resources. He kind of has a boring voice. I really enjoyed this class and he is very cool in office hours. Say hi. He loves it when people go to his office hours. He is very eccentric and cool. Just be on top of things and you will learn a lot. I took this class with no cs experience.",
      "Harvey is very prepared, and gives clear, thorough lectures. I am a potential cog sci major, and I thought this class was pretty difficult, but more time-consuming than anything. Be prepared to sacrifice a huge chunk of time to this class, unless you are a comp genius. Good class though, very educational.",
      "Keeps class interesting, and teaches well",
      "Fun class. I went to the lectures because I don't like watching webcasts. Good, interesting lecturer, homeworks are good, projects are ok but not too bad. Tests were pretty easy for me. This class opens up lots of different perspectives about programming.",
      "great lecturer, but fell asleep in class a couple of times just because the room was comfortable. knows his stuff, always prepared. even if you do bad on tests there's always homework and project that can boost up your grade. work in this class is extremely time consuming, some concepts are very hard to understand as well",
      "Overall he's an ok professor. His lectures can be boring at times. The exam questions are sometimes coming out of the blue, but you can still get a decent grade without doing great on all the tests.",
      "He is a good lecturer, but lectures can get boring at times. The class is easy in general, but some of the programming can get difficult.",
      "Good lecturer, knows his stuff. Also when I visited him during office hours, he took a lot of time to patiently explain to me what I didn't understand in class. Wish all computer science professors were like that.",
      "The class would have been better if I hadn't lost interest in the material (not really his fault but I changed my major out of CS after this class). Good lecturer, knows his stuff, I used his book for an earlier CS class and it was great but the book for this one can get confusing. Tests are relatively hit or miss, I ranged from 40% to 80% on them.",
      "Clear class, straightforward, well planned out. Harvey literally wrote the book on Scheme. At least one of them. Definitly knows how to lecture - he's the 'designated lecturer' for the CS department.",
      "Harvey rocks",
      "Brian is an amazing cs prof. He knows his stuff and gives clear lectures. I initially suffered from a lack of interest in cs, but this class may have just changed things.",
      "Knows what he's talking about and is able to put things in simple terms so most people can understand. Tests and other work is fairly straightforward and simple enough if you know what you're doing.",
      "Great teacher. He explained the material very well during lectures and gave great examples. Very clear. He seemed interested in teaching and stayed focused on the material. Engaging, even inspiring at times. The class was a great experience for me. You don't need to take CS 3 before this. Fabulous GSIs when I was taking it; best of luck regarding that.",
      "Okay prof. Pretty dry, but then the entire course can be so. You may hear his Beatles ringtone once in a while. Uncurved scale (which worked for me and my C- ). Tests somewhat hard, especially tree program-writing problems, and programming in general is time-consuming. Passable with an awesome TA like Wei (graduated) and good project scores.",
      "Spent long hours doing the projects. Boring lectures, but he is funny and gives the concepts, but hte tests are all writing programs. Long projects and TA's tend to not help too much on them and were like &quot;you need to do this&quot; and I was like &quot;I know I need to do that, but how&quot; but the TA doesnt help with that.",
      "Harvey is quite clear (although sometimes boring), and incredibly helpful. He posts in the course newsgroup often to help out students on HW and projects, and will help via email/office hours. CS61A is no walk in the park, so don't expect it to be a breeze. Harvey's exams are fair, but they are uncurved, so it can be tough sometimes. Good professor",
      "He was very clear with the material, which is good because the book (SICP) was very dense and difficult to understand. He answered questions well in class. Homework was hard, projects were fair, although project 4 was very difficult. I personally felt the midterms and final were hard, although some of my friends thought they were easy.",
      "if you're reading this, he's probably the only option at professor, it's not impossible, but real darn hard, as a professor he's fine, just be sure to download the answers to homework and projects or find some smart kids to work with",
      "Harvey is a very helpful teacher but DO NOT take this class if you haven't taken CS 3 or the AP computer science exam (meaning, don't go into it without significant programming experience).",
      "Great teacher. Harvey is interested in how best to teach computer science and it shows when he does teach. I learned a ton in the class, and never had any problems with the way it was taught.",
      "Harvey is a great professor and runs a very fair class. I really enjoyed his class.",
      "Once of the best profs I've ever had in Berkeley. Nice grading system and fair tests. This is not an easy class, but Harvey has made it manageable. If you can't stay awake in lecture, just watch the webcast.",
      "Excellent in explaining and answering questions, uses teaching aids really well and answer students newsgroup &#63;'s very quickly even at 3AM. Test are hard but certainly doable, projects are fun but don\u2019t leave them till the last minute. Hw and labs are hard but prepare you for exam. Doesn\u2019t grade hw for correctness, only for effort. Pretty nice guy.",

      "Very chill and obviously cares a lot about the students and the topic! Take if interested in patent engineering, IP strategy, and litigation.",
      "IEOR 190G: The class is great for scientists and engineers looking to go into industry, as well as business and prelaw students. Though Tal emphasizes that this isn't a legal course, it teaches you things about the patent system that you would overlook or underemphasize in a legal course. I'm a pre-law science major and I loved the course.",
      "Enthusiastic professor that focusses more on participation than just checking boxes. Course was fun and I definitely learned a LOT that's applicable to basically any hot tech career: entrepreneurship, engineering, consulting, VC, law... The only negative thing that I didn't enjoy was that the class seemed fairly disorganized.",
      "Really enjoyed the class. The homework can be annoying sometimes because it's easy to forget about it until it's due on Saturday nights. Regardless, interesting class that has no tests, quizzes or papers. The only HW is blogs and YouTube videos. Easy A.",
      "Very passionate about the subject. There for his students. Engaging homework assignments that utilize social media",
      "Very interesting class on patents. Homework is very manageable (about 2 hours per week). I would definitely recommend taking this class during your time at Cal.",
      "Good class to take because it may seem like a trivial subject but it actually has a lot of uses, and I can take many things in my daily life and it would have something to do with patents. Also, no tests or midterms, lots of social media use",
      "I love Tal",
      "Pretty good professor, lectures can be a little dry but he is very knowledgeable about IP. He also creates a great learning environment with the homework. Overall, nice guy who cares a lot about students learning and will teach you a lot!",
      "Tal was always excited about the topic he was teaching and was always flexible in regards to homework. He let the class decide what the homework was every week.",
      "Swaglord Tal was chill and awesome.",
      "Fun class",
      "Prof. Lavian is really sweet, knowledgable, and helpful. I love him as a teacher and a person! He wants to be your friend and your teacher at the same time, which is awesome! He emphasizes on crowd-learning and learning through social media. Highly recommend his class if you're interested in getting a general overview of patents!",
      "Weekly homework, only takes 1-2 hours, but is not too difficult, involves weekly blog and youtube posts. Very easy to talk to, tries his best to help the students learn the material. Very interesting topics and has great guest lecturers.",
      "Tal was great. This class incorporated social media for homework which consisted of doing blog posts, youtube videos, and tweets about patent cases. This course was interesting in that you learned a bit more about patents. The 2 hour lectures were sometimes boring and material moved slowly. As in there would be a lot of repeated materials presented",
      "This was one of the most interesting classes that I have taken at Berkeley. Professor Lavian is passionate about the subject that he teaches. I would definitely recommend this class to a friend!",
      "This was a pretty fun class. I really only took this class because I needed 2 units, but I ended up enjoying it. The work is simple, it takes a few hours to do, but it's not that bad. This is a good class to take if you need units or have any interest in patents.",
      "I had a great time in Prof. Lavian's IEOR 190G \"Mobile Wireless Networking and Patent Engineering\" course. I learned quite a bit about patents and their importance and would definitely recommend taking this course.",
      "Interesting class. No complaints.",
      "Really interesting class with a nice professor. Professor Lavian is understandable, personable, and genuine. He really wants you to learn the material in the class and is less concerned with assessment. No tests/quizzes/difficult work. Be sure to attend though and be prepared to spend about 3 hours/week on the homework assignment.",
      "Professor Lavian is good and fun! His expectations are very clear with regard to the online homework. It's only graded for competition, and he is flexible with timing. It's also pick your own topic - so you don't get bored with it.",
      "great class pretty easy you learn a lot inspirational homework can take time but its not hard would highly recommend",
      "Great class",
      "Tal is awesome and cares about his students. He is extremely fair and generally only gives As. Weekly homework assignments are not too bad.",
      "Very passionate about the material and clearly loves teaching the class. Take if you are interested in how patents work, their history, etc. Not too much work.",
      "Tal really wants students to learn and is all about letting the students teach themselves.",
      "Interesting class. Teacher is very passionate about the material and loves teaching students. Class is 2 hours and can feel long at times. Homework takes time, like 1-2 hours per week. Overall, should be an easy A.",
      "Class was interesting and the only assignments were blog posts, youtube, and twitter posts. Tal is nice and he is very appreciative of student feedback.",
      "Emphasizes learning and retention of useful information to be applied to life over memorization of material and tests. The assignments are structured in a way that you learn and retain material without cramming for exams.",
      "Tal is one of the nicest professors I have met at Berkeley. He is really understanding about extensions as well. I truly enjoyed taking the class with him, even if the homework was a bit time Consuming over the semester.",
      "Great guy! Great class! Fun environment! No pressure, no tests! 10 out of 10, would take again",
      "This has been one of my most amazing classes here at Cal thus far! Professor Lavian truly approached the subject in an all-rounded fashion. I have learned alot about the subject and feel confident that I will definitely apply the skills that I have attained! - Alankrita Dayal",
      "Great professor who really cares about student and takes student opinions into structuring the course. Take it!",
      "Tal is awesome. This is a great class. He truly cares about students learning and genuinely does not care about quizzes or tests. He is very passionate and knowledgable about the material, and thus listening to his lectures is fun. I would highly recommend taking this class to anyone.",
      "Tal is a great professor. He makes the material super interesting and really engages students. I learned so much this semester-this is one of my favorite classes at Cal. In terms of grading, he is very fair and reasonable and also extensions are given! No final, midterm! Just blog posts & videos that are super fun and interesting! TAKE THIS CLASS!",
      "Great professor and great class.",
      "Fantastic lecturer that knows his stuff, Professor Lavian is one of the most read, highly intelligent patent engineers ever! His expertise and passion for patents shows through in his teaching, yet he remains steadfastly friendly and approachable. Explains the difficult world of patents clearly and concisely. One of the best at Berkeley. Period.",
      "Teacher was one of the BEST TEACHERS I'VE HAD AT CAL. He focused on core concepts for the class. There were no tests or midterms - he didn't care about those and route memorization, but rather just wanted us to learn key takeaways that we would actually be able to apply to our working lives in the future. Blogs & videos as homework - interactive!",
      "Great professor but assigns SO MUCH HW. I didn't realize what I was getting myself into when I took the class with all these blog posts and YouTube videos... But regardless I recommend this course"

      "CS189 is hard but Prof. Shewchuk was a great lecturer for this course. Lectures were clear and built intuition. Section was math-heavy and homeworks are long and tough. A lot of leg work is needed to understand the theoretical aspects of the course. Work all proofs and algorithms thoroughly. Spend 25 hours/week. Exams have harsh grading schemes.",
      "Awesome clarity!",
      "I love Shewchuk. He is the most ideal form of a professor: explains concepts, curves nicely, reasonable exams.",
      "Watch his youtube lectures they are great at helping you understand. Helped me pass data structures",
      "My #1 or #2 favorite professors at Cal. He is THE best professor at public speaking (and has his own advice about it on his website). He is also organized in every way, from lectures to grading rubrics. He's funny without seeming to try (and don't even try cheating). I would definitely recommend, but he doesn't seem to teach as much as he used to.",
      "He's a dull lecturer, but lectures are straightforward and helpful. Labs are pretty easy, but homework is hard. Exams are open book and open note, but can be challenging. Projects aren't graded until late in the semester, so be ready for that.",
      "Fantastic lecturer, and the lecture notes he posts online are incredibly helpful. Exams are challenging but doable (buy the reader). If you want to take some time off to laugh a bit during dead week, go to the final lecture.",
      "He is one of the best Professor I have ever seen. He's so jovial and knows exactly what he was saying.",
      "Shewchuk is the best! His lectures were amazing and he is a great lecturer. Exams were very fair and similar to previous year's [buy the reader!]. He also has a fantastic taste in music",
      "Fantastic professor and a genuinely nice guy. He's very respectful and teaches well. Attending his lecture is always a joy, and his exams are of reasonable difficulty. They're the type of exams where you walk out with a better grasp of the material than you had when you walked in. He gives a lot of practice exams, too.",
      "The course material that he prepared (several years ago) is pretty much gold; it's possible to not even go to lecture because his notes are that good (and he follows the notes anyways). Beware that his exams are generally harder than his homeworks though.",
      "Great Professor!",
      "Excellent professor. Clear with the concepts. He writes a lot in the class. That's of great deal.",
      "Shewchuk is awesome. He's amazingly clear, seems to genuinely want you to learn, and he's funny to boot. Definitely one of the best professors at Cal.",
      "It's been 10 years since I had his class in data structures and he was definitely one of my most memorable. His class is moderately tough but not impossible. I can definitely thank him for his thorough teachings.. the programming skills really come in handy in the real world.!",
      "Great professor. Lectures and lecture notes are very clear and helpful. The homework, projects, and tests were fair. The material is useful and very applicable. Probably the best teacher to take 61B with.",
      "He is just awesome.period.",
      "His lecture notes are very helpful. Be sure to study them carefully",
      "spends so much time to make sure u understand it he is the best in EECS",
      "Very clear during lecture, quick to answer questions, very intelligent and helpful. Studying is a must, as the second midterm I got a D when I decided to skip a few lectures and not read, but my first midterm and final weren't bad since I actually worked. Shewchuck gives you the tools you need to get a good grade, but it is up to you to hone them.",
      "I loved this class. Clearest professor I've ever had, and he doesn't put you to sleep. Homework can be lame sometimes, but the projects were all actually fairly enjoyable. He's got a great sense of humor, teaches well, has decently fair exams (midterm 2 was hell), and constantly helps out on the newsgroup (checking this is vital to your grade).",

      "Great professor. Good at explaining. The best part of his class though is that his homeworks and projects are meaningful and fun. No pointless exercises, just programs and games that are interesting in to code.",

      "Data 8 was an amazing class and Wagner did a great job teaching it! Exams are fine if you pay attention in class and lab.",
      "Prof Wagner is so down-to-earth and knowledgable in his field. He is good at teaching his lectures in such a way as to make things simple enough for students to understand it. I wish he received more credit! I really appreciated having him as a professor in Data 8.",
      "Ramesh and Wagner are both great professors with their own style (fall 2018). I hardly went to lecture bc everything is webcasted. I dont like stats but learning python and the class over all is cool. So many resources, help, review, support, etc... Wagner is super corny sometimes its hilarious and Ramesh is cheesy but they both care a lot about",
      "He is passionate about what he teaches and it's contagious to his students! He is upbeat and willing to answer any of your questions. The class for Data 8 is also incredibly beginner-friendly and graded pretty fairly.",
      "David Wagner is an incredibly nice professor. He always has a smile on his face and cares immensely about his students.",
      "I took Data 8 with Wagner and Denearo fall 2017 and it is so clear how much effort they put into carefully crafting this class. Wagner is passionate, clear, and tried to break down things to make them accessible and not intimidating. I highly recommend this class and this professor.",
      "Wagner is clear, articulate and gives great lectures which cover all the material comprehensively. Ideal pace in data 8 for someone with no prior coding experience. Outside class, he is approachable, helpful and likes talking about his research. Great professor.",
      "Very good professor. Starts classes off with lame jokes, but lecturing is extremely clear, uses easy to follow examples and is helpful towards everyone. Tests can be tricky and homework can be hard though. Overall, highly recommended!",
      "Clear lectures and amazing responsiveness in class and on the on-line newsgroup. Homeworks are occasionally too difficult but they are well-designed. Discussions can be a letdown compared to lecture. The tests are a little inconsistent in difficulty and fairness but are much less painful than others (e.g., CS61C).",
      "There's so few ratings for this professor only because he's so good. He probably has the highest rating of any teacher on the HKN surveys. His CS170 class has well over 200 people signed up because he's so good. If you have the change to take him, take him.",
      "The clearest teacher I've ever had. Down-to-earth, witty, and ridiculously smart. He's extremely helpful if you ask him questions, because he knows what the root of your misconceptions are. This guy is awesome."

      "Is great at explaining hard topics, and makes sure his students understand before moving on. He shows that he loves the subject matter and shares it with his students.",
      "He knows the materials that he is teaching very well. Lecture attendance is helpful since the CS70 materials are thinkers. Throughout the course, you should prepare for the exam that will bite you if you don't study for it. Funny story: Once a fire alarm went off in adjacent building Vazirani told students to leave but he went on with the lecture.",
      "He is a very humble man, considering his accomplishments. He is not the most exciting lecturer, but he does give clear explanations. You don't have to know quantum mechanics before you take the class, but you do have to learn it to pass. A good background in linear algebra is very helpful.",
      "He teaches very intuitively and everything just fits in its place. He teaches such topic which even einstein didn't believed so easily. He is very modest also.",
      "A fun professor who often speaks a little too quietly (try to sit in front, but if you're in 101 McCone like us, make sure you're not in the middle, where you can't see the board). CS70 was very enjoyable up until after the second midterm, when it became very vague and abstract, but still one of my favorite classes at Cal.",
      "A great and very modest professor who greatly respects his student's ideas and lectures with clarity and style. cs70 is my favorite class at Cal because of Prof. Vazirani."

I became an awesome programmer. Amir rocks",

Discussions are good indicators of exam questions (exams are hard, do practice ones). homeworks and projects are meant to be challenging (piazza 24/7) and for the love of God get a good partner, start early! the textbook is great",
      "Prof. Kamil is nice, funny, and his hints are usually helpful on projects and homework. Lectures are webcast. Tests are difficult, grading is fair. Projects are difficult, but fun. I came into this with no cs experience and did well. Everything assignment in this class is very time consuming. Overall, great experience.",

      "Professor Hug is a diamond in the rough that is the engineering field. Above all else, he's deeply invested in his students' well being, goes out of his way to help anyone who needs it, and values ethics. His lectures are clear and thoughtful, he's accessible at his office hours, and his cheesy humor never fails to put a smile on everyone's face.",
      "Hug is by far one of the best professors I've had - he really cares about the students and will approach you to check in with you if you have questions during his office hours. His lectures are really interesting and he's truly a gem. The projects were rough but he provided so many resources to help us finish and the exams have been extremely fair.",
      "Very nice professor.",
      "Overall I liked Hug's teaching style and laid-back-ness. I found his lectures decently entertaining. Two downsides for me, though, were lack of organization (like getting assignments out on time), and subtle hints of condescension or not caring a lot about the students on an individual basis. But still worth it to take his class!",
      "Hug is a really inspirational teacher. He clearly cares about his students, is easy to talk to, and manages the class very well. He is very receptive and responsive to any feedback from the students, so the class is fair. This semester, however, the large software engineering pro37ject, Editor, was extremely difficult. But overall, an amazing prof.",
      "His lectures were really fun and a bunch of humor, but at the same time, he told us difficult cs concepts easily. He is always welcome to questions, about anything not only lectures. Thanks to his great lectures and highly organized class to make students get interested in CS, many students including me decided to major in CS in UCB. HE IS AWESOME.",
      "Highly recommend beginning a computer science education with Josh. He makes learning CS meaningful and empowering to even the most novice computer scientist. I genuinely looked forward to Josh's lectures -- they are informative and engaging, not to mention funny.",
      "Great Professor! His lectures were always webcast and interesting to listen to. Even without a strong foundation in Computer Science, I felt very confident leaving the class. Overall a great experience. 10/10 would reccomend.",

During exams, if you payed attention in lecture, did well on the projects, and go through the problems carefully, you should be fine. He was great for my first CS professor.",

I emailed him on average 10 emails per proj/hw, and he would patiently answer all of them, and I'm just ONE of about 200 of his students! The only prof that would top his teaching style is probably Nachenberg",

I found the class very difficult due to having no prior programming experience whereas most of the class did...I would not recommend taking this class without trying to learn some C++ first because otherwise you will find it HARD.",

      "If he confuses you look up Myers Briggs Typology Indicator. He introduced it to class in one of his CSE 142 lectures that he (stuart reges) is INFP. Truly inspirational.",
      "One of the best professors the University of Washington could offer. I never thought of majoring in CS/CE but I seriously considered it after taking the class. His lectures are very fun, polished, and informational.",
      "Stuart is a veteran in cs, but he is the common student's professor. Makes computer science accessible even if you don't have any previous experience. Lectures are enjoyable, as you don't really need to take notes and he has a good sense of humor. CS 142 is a tough class, but easily manageable if you stay up to speed with lectures.",
      "I would recommend using the book to do practice problems. I did lots of practice it (UW online java practice programming problems) and honestly even though it helps I only got a 3.4 because I honestly wrote messy code in the two exams, and lost points on the hard programming question for both exams. I would advise use the textbook.",
      "I've really enjoyed Reges, he's funny, but most importantly very good at explaining the concepts we are learning. Even though CSE 143X is a fast course, he has made it possible to keep up by being very decisive in his lectures. He also tells you all the important things you need for the tests and homework. I haven't really had to read the textbook.",
      "Reges is a very inspiring professor to learn from. Admittedly, I had him for a seminar class and not a 14x course, but he consistently blew our minds with new concepts. He's also a great guy to talk to overall as he's very down to earth despite his legendary status. Take the 143 honors seminar if you can - it will change your life.",
      "Not to hard to get 3.5+ as you do a lot practiceit problems everyday that are related to whats gonna be on the test. Also make sure to practice every single type of question on the test and that you know how to do them. Tests aren't bad as long as you practice ALOT for everything. As for homework just make sure you read the specs carefully.",
      "Getting a good grade is not too hard in this class. His tests are very straightforward and he often recycles a big portion of the questions that are on the test. One nice thing, when I took the class, 50 percent of the final points were questions from his archive. But if you want to do well in his class, you need to study everything on this tests",
      "Reges' lectures were hands down the best lectures I took all my education career (and I'm currently a doctoral student so I had quite a bit) I'm glad he was the one who laid down my programming fundamentals. Very tough grader so my GPA did indeed took a hit but I never would have changed his course for anything else.",
      "Excellent lectures. Difficult to talk to outside of class. Only ever attended the first lecture. Panopto is awesome.",
      "Decent lecturer but a bit overrated in my opinion. Pretty rude and not very accessible too. Grading is mostly based on a series of arbitrary style deductions including things such as use of advanced concept as point deductions. I got a pretty good grade but truly believe the 14x series is poorly designed.",
      "Great teacher and super based guy - in fact he used to be director of the libertarian party. If you're trying to get into CS you really need to get a high grade in this class. (142/143)",
      "This is a HARD class. Stuart didn't fail to deliver in teaching the class; he's a funny and very interesting person which made lecture enjoyable. I think a few things about the course itself (which Stuart made) could be revamped though. For example, binary trees need to be introduced way earlier for any chance on getting good a final grade.",
      "The intro CS classes are meant to be weed out classes, so not easy, but definitely a class where effort correlates with grade. He is one of the best lecturers I have had at UW, but not one of the most approachable. Style points on the homeworks are a huge grade killer. I received a decent grade because I did a ton of Practice-It before exams.",
      "I had Stuart for 142, 143, and the 143 honor's discussion. He is an awesome and incredibly knowledgable prof, and funny too. He doesn't put up with nonsense but I really enjoyed all of his classes. Take his honor's section if you can because it was crazy cool getting to know him on a personal level outside of lecture. Great prof would take again",
      "He is the mastermind of CSE 14X is the best lecturer in the series. His lectures are amazing and usually come straight out of the textbook, which make the textbook optional, but a great choice to review his material for homework. Stuart is a love him/hate him professor and most people love him!",
      "Stuart is a great lecturer, and the homework assignments are actually fun projects. Be prepared to lose a lot of style points. It's a really challenging course but it's worth it. The exams are very predictable and he's very upfront about what to expect if you do old exams.",
      "This is my second class by Stuart and I enjoyed it even more than the first. The homework was brilliant, it breaks you down for a couple over hours before the \"aha!\" moment when you understand a subject. Stuart is also funny and lets the TAs sneak in little jokes in assignments.",
      "Stuart is an amazing professor who is genuinely unique. He may be more difficult than other professors if you're just starting off with CS, but he has such a unique way of explaining concepts.",
      "Interesting lectures. Exams seem to be not very hard. You only need to practice for a little while then u should be fine. But homework assignments can be tricky. Be careful.",
      "Stuart is the bomb. The class is NOT easy, it's like a weed wacker for the absurd amount of students aiming for Computer Science here. Stuart's lectures are funny, he adds references to shows I like (wubalubadubdub!) and there is a ton of practice material for the exams. Get ready to lose some style points in this class, and for good reason!",
      "Stuart is an entertaining guy-- his lectures are interesting enough to keep you awake and he does a good job at introducing hard Java topics to complete beginners. The only issue was the grading system used for the homework which sometimes seems rather ridiculous. Overall, I learned a lot in Stuart's class and really recommend taking him.",
      "Reges himself is really funny. He can waste time from time to time talking about facts irrelevant to the course, but it can be interesting to some people. The problem is the TA selection and the ambiguity in the grading. The grading is really harsh on homework, but on the exams it's really fair. The TAs are undergrads so they can be incompetent.",
      "Professor Reges is a great professor! His lecture is always interesting and the knowledge is showed extremely clear. He often said analogies and jokes in lecture. And after lecture he will answer students' questions if you come to ask him.",
      "Let me be clear on this: I think Stuart is a good teacher. My main issue is really with how the course is designed. I think that having 50% of your homework grade based on arbitrary \"style\" points is ridiculous and seems to be an excuse to create grade deflation because of how competitive UW's computer science department is.",
      "Stuart is hilarious! Definitely one of my favorite professors. You'll do fine if you go to lecture and do the work. My only complaint is that most of his analogies are about fridges.",
      "Best lecturer I've ever had. If you go to class and pay attention, he explains things so clearly that you won't even need to read the textbook. If you understand it, the homework doesn't take too long but is graded pretty strictly. He's pretty good about taking questions but the class is so big that going to the IPL for help is a better bet.",
      "very clear in every details, especially in CSE142 pay attention to each homework from the beginning to the end, every parts are equally significant for doing well in this course do practise-it (an website for online practising) before exams, or you will fail good luck",
      "Lectures are fun! Best professor",
      "He teaches the intro level the way it should be taught. As someone who didn't have any prior programming experience I felt comfortable with the difficulty and expectations of the course. Everyone should definitely go to lectures because he gives hints for tests.",
      "Really interesting teacher",
      "The best way to excel in this class is by practicing minimum 5 problems of Practice it everyday. I did not do great on the midterm but started practicing everyday for the final and did really well on it. Other than that he is a great lecturer. He has a tendency of doing tough concepts right at the end though.",
      "Hwk gets time consuming as the quarter goes on, so make time for it! It was my first time programming and I was very confused at the beginning which is why I got a bad grade on the midterm and an average grade over all. Quiz section taught me more than Stuart for sure. Wasn't that interested in the subject at first but now I love it!",
      "Glad I signed up for the lab (1-credit CSE 190). You can lose very easy points for the homework because of \"style points\". Stuart Reges uses analogies so you should read the book and do practice-it problems BEFORE attending the lecture. Also you should go to Autumn 2015's CSE 142 website to do the homework 1 and 2 BEFORE day 1 of class. Hard exams.",
      "Stuart is a great guy. Just expect to spend a lot of time with hw. You will stress out about hw if you care about your grade because you can not fck up simple things or it will hurt you like a mthrfckr. Also, there is no curve at least for my quarter. I recommend that you prepare to take two easy courses along this course especially4 1st qrter",
      "I loved Reges and his class. You don't really interact with him, but with the TA's. Regardless, Reges has a passion for code and he brings it to lecture. He tries to make you love CS just as much as he does, and it so shows. His assignments are difficult, but fascinating, and the structure of the class is excellent. Highly recommended!",
      "This class has some students with java experience, \"hares\". Make sure you do practice-it problems before each lecture, as the metaphors may help - or not. Quiz sections depend on your TA, some are good some are more useless. Sign up for the CSE 190 lab- handy when you need help with some conceptual questions. Lectures recorded in CSE 142 website.",
      "He's a funny guy. Google him ;p",
      "He's really cold and when you're in for office hours, it feels like he wants you to leave. Lectures were okay, pretty basic stuff. Not much to say really; he just gives lectures and leaves. His analogies are a hit or miss. Oh and he sometimes makes inappropriate jokes or just passes comments that are rude.",
      "Dr. Reges is pretty fantastic. CSE 142 is designed for people who have never touched computer programming before, and he does an amazing job of teaching from the ground up. He usually stays a while after lecture to answer any questions. His lectures are essentially quoted from the textbook, or vice versa, so both are great ways to learn.",
      "Great lecturer overall. Before taking 142, I had no idea about how to program but I felt that Stuart walked me through the basics of Java very well. His cookies are very good so good that I think that he bakes them with weed ;)",
      "Lectures are good. Lecture slides provided online are extremely helpful, especially if you miss a day. There were weekly homework assignment, moderately hard for people new to coding. Class was fun and challenging. Even if you're not a computer science major, I recommend trying this class. Textbooks are useful, but not necessary.",
      "The best lecturer ever in my whole life!",
      "He is a GREAT professor! Lectures are clear and interesting. But coding is more of your own work. You need a lot of practice to get a high grade on this course. Attendance are not mandatory but you need to go to them to have a better understanding. Overall it's great but it is really hard for an intro-level course. Have to put in lots of efforts.",
      "Awesome professor. Do the work, study for his tests, and you can definitely get a good grade.",
      "Reges is hands down the best professor I've taken a class with at the UW. I had no programming experience before taking 142 but by attending lecture and doing homework I got an A in the course. Reges has great analogies that really helped me understand a lot of the topics covered (wish I could say the same for my 143 prof). If you take CS, Reges!",
      "Great teacher you'll love the class. Assignments aren't too hard it's mainly style that counts.",
      "Best 14x professor out there.",
      "I never took a CSE class in high school so the material was entirely new to me. I had to do a lot of reading and practice problems to keep up with everyone else and the pace of the class. However, during lecture Reges is AMAZING! He's very clear, has a sense of humor, and is passionate about the topic. Learn to debug your programs.",
      "Reges is a veteran prof and one of the best in the field. He designed pretty much the whole CS curriculum and he is the best prof you can have for 142143. His lectures are absolutely amazing and helpful for both tests and homework. 142 is a weedout class so grading is artificially hard, pay attention to style. Go to IPL and talk to TAs",
      "Great professor, loves his jobs and shows in lectures. Get a head start on the homework, don't wait until two days prior to start.",
      "Awesome lecturer, he is clearly passionate about teaching this course and has excellent explanations. The grading is very specific and unbending, double check all your assignments, do practice-it (the textbooks online practice website) and you'll do fine. Highly recommend the class.",
      "Stuart is an amazing prof. He is really excited about CS and uses amazing non-technical analogies to explain techie concepts. He really sets you up for success in hw during lecture, so go to class! The textbook is essentially the same, & if you want to do well on tests, start early, do Practice-it the entire quarter & take lots of practices tests.",
      "Great class! It's not too hard if you put a little effort into learning the subject matter. Homework can be frustrating because if you do not do it their way, you'll lose points, but you can ultimately understand why they grade it that way.",
      "This class with Reges was amazing! Everything was explained very clearly and the lectures always captured my attention. You can tell that he is passionate about his field and I've never felt more interested in majoring in CS than after this class.I really enjoyed taking this class, although some of the grading on the assignments was kind of harsh.",
      "Absolutely hilarious lecturer. Good at explaining concepts in a funny way. Really helpful. I enjoyed his lectures.",
      "Professor Reges is very funny in class and keeps the topics interesting so that the class won't get too technical to a point that is boring. He gives metaphor that makes programming really easy to understand(though some of them are cheesy). Some say he is a harsh grader, but if you pay attention in lecture and go to quiz sections,easy A.",
      "Stuart is great! He really likes what he is doing and that really shows. His assignments are just amazingly fun puzzles to do every week. I really appreciated his non-technical examples. For CSE majors, pay attention to the complexity stuff because I regret not listening as much. Go to the IPL and do the honors 14x section if you can!!",
      "A very good professor. He explains everything clearly. One very good tip to study for midterm and final: go over ALL old midterms and finals that he provide and understand them, because there's a high chance that they will appear on your test (8 of 10 questions were reused for Winter 2014 final exams)",
      "Very interesting and fun class.",
      "He's a great lecturer and teaches the material with passion and clarity. However, he tries to weed out too hard, often in bad ways. You *will* lose points on homework for style and his tests are structured like so: 70% of it is easy and the last 30% is meant to make most people fail. Note: he reuses most of his material from past quarters.",
      "Stuart does a great job explaining how to do the homework and how to prepare for the tests. The only difficult part is not losing style points on the homework, which can be challenging at times.",
      "Stuart is a great professor! He's enthusiastic and makes the interesting material even more fun to learn. The homework isn't bad at all, I usually finished in 1-2 hours. Easily my favorite professor and course at UW!",
      "Stuart was a very good professor. In section X we moved very quickly through the material, but I think Stuart did a very nice job, overall, of getting the information across. My biggest piece of advice for this course is to put a good amount of effort into the homework, because it will help your grade at the end if you are not a great test-taker.",
      "Best professor I've had! His class never gets dull!!",
      "Great professor. I loved going to lecture. Material was interesting and well paced for a student who had never been exposed to programming before.",
      "Great intro lecturer, coming in with no experience he's great at explaining exactly what you need to know. Don't miss lecture though otherwise you will have to work to make up points",
      "For this class, each HW will consume about 3 - 5 hours and he'll give you a week long. Exams are straight forward with questions similar to quiz sections. Book is useless since everything you need will need will be posted online. He is very clear in explaining the lecture and what he is expecting you to do. Good professor, recommended.",
      "Excellent Professor",
      "I am taking Stuart's class right now. If you have never programmed before, it's going to take you way out of your comfort zone. CSE is whole new level of thinking. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't take the class. Stuart loves teaching and he's funny as well. He tries to be as clear as possible. Homework took me about 3-4 days to complete btw.",
      "Best professor I have had yet at the University of Washington. I'm never bored in class, never have to read the textbook because of his great lessons and explanations, and he always has a good joke or two",
      "I LOVE Stuart Reges!! He is honestly the most enthusiastic professor that I have ever had and he makes me want to go to class more often than not. I have never felt this way about any course I have taken in the past and I am so unbelievably glad that I have gotten the chance to be taught by this man. Twice, even! CSE 142 & CSE 143! Thank You!!",
      "Genius of analogy",
      "I hope I fail this class so I can take it again and again",
      "One of my favourite professors so far. His lectures basically give you everything you need to know and has a great sense of humor.",
      "I hated programming before taking this class. I am now pursuing computer science. Enough said.",
      "Super clear, explain things very well. Love his analogies. Class is engaging. Wants the students to think the same way as he do, which is sometimes not very good. Usually reuse worksheet problems on the exam. Overall, Great professor.",
      "I'll put it this way, CSE 142 was the hardest class I've ever taken at UW. Other math and science classes went reasonably well for me. There is a catch, if you find your brain is wired to code, this will be a very fun class. If not, it will be brutal. Unfortunately, as far as the class went, I was one of the few who didn't quite ever get it.",
      "Stuart was a great professor, one of my favorites so far. He isn't easy, but no CS class truly is. What he does bring to the table is his wonderful talent for providing clarity in his explanations of concepts in class. Don't skip. The lectures are definitely worth attending for his good use of examples and occasional witty moments.",
      "Reges was my first CS teacher, and after finishing the 2 introductory class from him I became a CS major. He is clear and gets occasional laughs from the class. The workload is not too heavy, and no prior programming language is required for 142. Recommend.",
      "This is a hard class. I took AP Computer Science in high school but opted for a swimming class after the first semester. Computer science is a difficult subject. However, Reges is very clear when he explains things and this makes the class much easier than it could be otherwise. Highly recommended.",
      "Great professor who's very passionate about CSE. He's pretty amusing and keeps you awake. You don't technically have to be \"naturally born with talent\", you just need to able to work independently and spend time to understand what you learned and how to apply it.",
      "Awesome lecturer, shows great interest in subject and excellent use of analogies and examples make is possible for anyone to understand. I don't buy the &quot;if you're not naturally gifted at CS you'll do bad,&quot; crap. To succeed in this kind of class, you have to put in a lot of time outside of class.",
      "AWESOME PROFESSOR! Interesting, clear, concise, gives excellent analogies and explanations. Posts clear lecture notes and practice exams online. Class is curved so easiness has nothing to do with professor, so its hard to get a high grade. TA-led quiz sections and out-of-class practice crucial to success. Really anal on how homework is graded.",
      "Yes, the class is hard and he is a genius. Yes, he's arrogant but he deserves it (totally). Yes, he's involved with MDA or whatsoever. I mean... Who cares. If u always expect a perfect teacher who is humble, gives reasonable exams, n have no controversy, u're living in the never land or u're a twilight fan...",
      "This class is pretty hard if you're a nonmajor and don't think like a computer scientist, though through no fault of Stuart's. The guy is nothing short of a genius and teaches very well. I just found the content very difficult while many of my peers breezed through the class.",
      "Extremely precise and engaging; exactly what a CSE professor should be",
      "Reges is awesome!! He cares about what he's teaching, and he loves teaching. There is more than ample practice and advise offered, all you have to do is make use of the resources and you should do fine. I loved the programming assignments, even if at times they could be frustrating. Both cse 142 & 43 were great w/ Reges.",
      "A great professor! Reges is a genius and he is well aware of that, so I see why some people might mistake geniusness for arrogance. He is strict with grading, however if you attend lectures and sections do homework you have nothing to worry about! Also, his lectures are usually very interesting and he is very passionate about teaching!",
      "Probably my favorite professor at UW so far. Not an easy class, the tests were pretty hard, but I learned so much, and Regis had an entertaining way of teaching! I loved this class!",
      "The GOOD: entertaining lectures, good explanations, and he starts on-time and won't waste you're time in class. The BAD: Even if you are generally a good student, the tests are stupid hard. As in HARD. It's not enough to read the book, read lecture notes, and do the homework--you need natural talent. Welcome to UW.",
      "Stuart is a boss, I highly recommend him whether you have prior CS experience or not. I took the class originally to fulfill a prereq but grew to the love the subject. The material can be tricky, but if you put sufficient effort and attend lectures/sections you can get a good grade, even if you've never wrote a line of code in your life.",
      "the teacher is very good however if you arent for programming then you have to work very hard... i took cse the second time and i didnt do that good. I think im just not for programming... i spend like 2-3 days to finish the hw.. the exam is pretty clear.. he lets you know the format of the exam.. i recommend to take reges class",
      "I had never programmed before, so I really appreciated his clarity and straightforwardness. He's also really funny in an awkward way =] I highly recommend this class.",
      "Good teacher for those who had never even attempted to program before.",
      "Crystal clear, articulate, and approachable to discuss concepts. His exams are always fair - though they will test you under high time pressure. He has a good knack of explaining why a theory or operation is relevant and where it fits into larger perspective - which really helps you think. Be prepared to work a bit in his class, though.",
      "I had Reges for 142 and 143. His lectures were pretty laid back but very useful. If you attend his lectures, you don't need to read the book much (although it's def still a good idea, esp. complexity and some other chapters). Some exams have a lot of time pressure, though, depending on your ability to think on your feet, so beware.",
      "One of the best lecturers I've had; he's hilarious, interesting, and great at providing analogies of difficult concepts. Very nit picky on homework though, especially in intro classes, and even for silly things like comments. Tests are tough, but follow a predictable format. Ensure you are proficient with exam type questions. Final = 40% of grade.",
      "I've had him for 143 and 341. Best professor I've ever had. Clear, articulate, prepared; he types up his class notes for you, and goes into special topics to keep it interesting. It's hard work, but worthwhile. Note that in his intro courses the syllabus he gives you shows the *minimum* percentage to get a grade; often 85% gets a 3.5.",
      "Generally agreeable guy in person and a pretty good lecturer. I had him for 143 and Stepp for 142, I prefer Reges. Assignments are hard, but if you go to lecture, there's nothing in them that you shouldn't get.",
      "Stuart is a nice guy! :-) :-0 ;-)",
      "Very clear lecturer and a very understandable textbook. This class is effing hard though. You have assignments every week that take forever and the midterm and final are very hard. Of course I may just be retarded, but I thought this was one of the hardest classes I've taken. I guess it just depends on whether you get programming or not.",
      "Reges is good with language. His lectures and textbook are both very good. You don't need prior programming experience, Stuart assumes you know nothing and explains everything. I didn't have programming experience and did better than many who did. Grading is easy if you adhere to assignment guidelines and do at least 3 practice midterms/finals.",
      "very hard class. the assignments are difficult. you must score above a 90% on everything in order to get an A. Confusing material. not recommended unless you need it for credit",
      "You need to pay attention and know what the hells going on otherwise the last 40-45 minutes of class are going to be useless.",
      "Awesome professor - very clear and engaging. However, must warn students about the difficulty of the class. You pretty much have to score 92%+ consistently on all homework/midterms/etc. in order to even be close to an A.",
      "I totally wish I had him as a teacher back in AP Computer Science in high school...Stuart is a wonderful teacher and his textbook Back to Basics is probably the best Java textbook EVER. Lecture is very engaging with plenty of interesting tidbits to keep you interested (Asciimation Star Wars, Knuthian hexidecimal dollar etc). MUST TAKE.",
      "The assignments will challenge you weekly, mainly with the picky little details, but they're very doable if you attend quiz sections and glance through your book. The class is east to get a B in, but difficult to get an A in. Stuart is very clear in lectures and is a clever, entertaining speaker.",
      "Class was well structured and covered necessary material in a clear fashion. Class was enjoyable to attend.",
      "back to basics rocks.",
      "Especially good at explaining the homeworks, which is good because they are pretty hard. Very good at describing concepts, though I sometimes feel fuzzy on the details. Has an annoyingly good ear - he often shushes the class when the noise level is fairly quiet for a hall with 200+ people in it.",
      "Stuart is a wonderful. He already knows that ~10% of the class already knows the material, so he much of his time lecturing to us students who are new to this. It is apparent when he covers a new topic; rather than breezing through material in an hour, he usually spends an entire week to ensure that the class understands the underlying idea. &lt;3",
      "He is great at teaching the material...unfortunately that is not enough to get you through the class. The assignments are difficult as well as the exams. Help is very limited, since asking for help is generally discouraged (and depending on the type of help, prohibited) due to his strict policies. Lowest grade I've received in any course.",
      "great teacher, just look out for the TA's.",
      "His lectures were very informative and interesting. I never needed the book(in fact I didn't buy one). The homework assignments sometimes take a while, be prepared. For the midterm, time was the primary issue. The grading is a bit on the harsh side. Do as many of the practice exams as possible. Enjoyable class, great professor. Highly recommended.",
      "Great teacher, really knows his subject.",
      "Hard class, if you are new to Java programming this class is difficult. Stuart really knows what he teaches but he knows it too well that sometimes he leaves students behind while catering to students who can write code in their sleep. He didn't seem to mind that over 1/2 the class failed the midterm. Midterm is a killer, final is not too bad.",
      "hard",
      "An excellent teacher, at least for those with an interest in the field (and quite possibly for those without one; I couldn't say). Not only is he very interested in whether or not the students learn, but he's excellent at helping them to do so.",
      "Lectures are very interesting and well thought out, his advice and tips are great, homework is also interesting and fun. His midterms are difficult because of time mainly (beware). Reges really knows his stuff also. =) Overall, his class is pretty laid back and just fun!",
      "Awesome guy.",
      "Very clear, very fun, hard grader, VERY hard to get a great grade, but easy to get a &quot;pretty good&quot; grade. Many hate him, many like him. One thing's for sure, however.. He WILL keep your interest in class and I believe he has influenced a lot of people to become CSE majors. He needs to be more approachable outside of class, however.",
      "Good man",
      "Amazing lecturer. I'd recommend him in a heartbeat. I especially recommend his honors section, should he offer it-- its an entertaining group discussion on topics ranging from Qubic to the Halting problem to RSA Encryption. His lectures are entertaining, his assignments are presented well, though for help outside of class, TAs have more time.",
      "great instructor, lectures always entertaining",
      "Reges is one of the best lecturers out there. He can explain complex topics in such a way that they seem intuitive (and he uses liberal amounts of humor to lighten the mood). Unlike some others here, I found him to be easy to talk to outside of lecture, so long as you don't ask questions that are designed to agitate or second guess him.",
      "Absolutley rediculous. listen in class and it's easy. And his metaphors are hilarious, though not intended to be so.",
      "This class was frustratingly easy, because the teacher gave away all of the hard parts of the homework in class, stopping us from having to think about it ourselves. Since it was graded on a curve, this evened out the grade across the class and stopped the smarter students from coming to the top of the class. Good for people who get bad grades.",
      "This man is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best professors I've ever had! He had a good sense of humor and made learning fun. He had these analogies that made our assignments easier to approach. He is the man!!",
      "Knows the material very well, very interested and enthused about it. Very clear teacher. The class is not easy, but he is a very good professor.",
      "i &lt;3 the star trek jokes! :D",
      "Lots of Star Trek jokes. Funny guy, very smart and enthusiastic.",
      "If you have any prior CS knowledge, this prof will be extremely easy. He's very clear, though, and very knowledgable. Definately recommended",
      "Interesting to listen to and all in all a good teacher.",
      "One of the UW's best professors. He's taken a course (CSE 142) that is renowned as being difficult and turned it into an enjoyable class that anyone can take and do well in without killing themselves in the process. Students should fight to have him as a professor (rather than have someone else).",
      "He's a cool professor that would talk non-stop from the beginning to the end. His sense of humor keeps most of us up during the 9:30 am class. The lecture are mostly interesting and easily understood.",
      "Extremely engaging, always keeps the class interested. Explains material so well that a 4-year-old could understand it, but without dumbing it down. Best teacher I've had so far (in 2 years). Had him for CS 245 (Intro to Discrete Math) at U of Arizona.",
      "Hey is a really nice (from what I can tell) and funny guy. He is a real geek at heart and makes lots of references to Star Trek.",
      "He is extremely helpful and always excited to talk to students. At least this quarter the midterm and final are open book and open notes, and he does not make them extremely difficult. I personally have had no prior programming experience and am understanding what he is teaching.",
      "Professor Reges is new to UW as of this quarter (Autumn 04), but has been great so far. He is humorous, gives out some interesting homework problems, and I can tell he is quite good at communicating to non-technical people, much better than me for sure. His midterms can be tricky, watch out.",
      "He is supposed to be the reorginizer of intro cs classes and is doing a decent job in cse 142. I does not teach theory and vocab, just programming basics. Becuase of the wide range of experience of the people in the class, it is hard to say if it is easy or not. Just depends on the person."

      "Really good lecturer, great at teaching",
      "He made most of Practice It! Amazing tool. Definitely changed the world for the better. Also responsible for the thousands of new students taking AP. Without PracticeIt those students would not be taking Computer Science. Wow.",
      "funny",
      "Marty is easily one of the best teachers at UW. He is very enthusiastic about the material he is teaching and jokes around keeping his lectures upbeat. Like most programers however, Marty is less patient with people who ask stupid questions. If you get the chance definitely take one of his classes.",
      "Awesome teacher.",
      "A very very very hard and time consuming class for a non major, but you will learn some very important skills and this class will help build your resume. I enjoyed this class and I learned I like the web-dev stuff more than the software side. After this class I made an art webpage for my friend.",
      "Marty is an awesome teacher, the lecture notes as well as screencasts are put online, so you don't have to go. Grading can be rough, lots of focus on efficiency and eliminating redundancy can cause you to lose point for little things. The final wasn't very easy,do the practice tests online with a timer for a good idea what you are up against.",
      "Great professor - I have had him for several classes, and his lectures are probably the only ones I do not fall asleep in. However, the material IS very difficult, and I believe he grades way too harshly. Also the tests on PAPER for a COMPUTER programming class are brutal. But I learned A LOT.",
      "Funny and very smart. Gives good lectures and is willing to give help. Very tough on grading, a little too tough in my opinion, but overall a good teacher.",
      "Fun! And hilarious!!! He's a GREAT teacher and makes the material soooo easy to understand.",
      "Awesome teacher made it an extremely fun class and great at explaining things. Learned a lot without any use in the textbook.",
      "Marty's hilarious and great at what he does. He provides tons of resources to succeed and has more office hours than many of my other teachers. Of course this may be because he's so popular. I knew that I wanted to go into computers before taking this class, but now I'm even more sure.",
      "Amazing prof, very approachable and is very willing to answer questions. Super entertaining lectures",
      "He's a tough teacher, but you really learn the material. He's also actually funny and I think that helps make the class less boring!",
      "Marty is extremely organized and clear in his teaching. He is absolutely hilarious. He is very approachable and easy to talk to. This class is really easy if you have a knack for problem solving and even slight prior programming experience.",
      "Great class. Great teacher. He's hilarious one of the best profs at UW.",
      "Extremely hard class, especially for people like me who had no prior programming experience. However, now that I've taken it there's no doubt that I want to be a CS major. I had to devote all academic energy into the class, but finishing the homework each week after ten hours of labor is possibly the most satisfying experience I've ever had.",
      "Great professor. Really clear on the subject matter and throws in jokes that are actually funny, not corny like a lot of profs/teachers. Highly recommend classes by him. Also, he wrote the textbook for 142/143 so he knows it well. Doesn't use it much though, so you can easily get away with sharing it with one or more people.",
      "smoking hot. good prof. great class.",
      "Great professor, super funny guy",
      "Really fun professor and easy to understand.",
      "Marty is a lot of fun. He can be a bit crud with jokes, but he means nothing bad by it. He knows what he's talking about and is easily approachable. His class is what made me switch from a Psych to an CS major. A lot of work, but there is a lot of help available!",
      "Very hard subject to learn. But Marty makes things really interesting, he's funny and keeps you awake with his jokes. It's highly recommended that you have prior programming experience before taking his 142 & 143 class cause they were two of the toughest classes I've taken. Overall he's a really good teacher.",
      "Runs a 200 person lecture with the ease of a 30 person class. Very clear expectations, you'll know exactly what you're being graded on. Material is difficult and takes more than the hours would indicate. Don't get lulled into &quot;I got this&quot; and start slacking. It's easy to get behind, and with the workload, tough to catch up.",
      "best. class. ever. I've never had a more interesting, informative, rolling-on-the-floor-laughing-humorous teacher. No, seriously, lectures are approaching stand-up-comic levels of hilarity. Yes, it's challenging, but it's so much fun I really didn't mind.Bottom line: this class made me become a computer science major. TAKE IT.",
      "Really easy, but his tests are getting old. Found like one or two questions that were either almost, or the same as one of the practice exams... Average is really high, so you can't slack off not even a day.",
      "Great guy! I had Marty for both 142 and 143, no other way to do it! His lectures are very enjoyable, and no surprises on exams. HW and tests can be hard, but attend lectures/ sections/get help when you need it, and you'll do fine. He got me interested in CS!",
      "This class was very challenging for me. Marty made the class entertaining even if mildly inappropriate. Programming is often the bane of peoples academic career but he made it as painless as it could be. Recommend.",
      "Awesome teacher, his lectures have to be the most entertaining that I have ever had. He is pretty funny during lectures and isn't above making fun of himself or other, more obnoxious students in the class. The class is difficult but my TA was excellent and Marty is always answering questions on the message boards. Sometimes at 3 in the morning!",
      "Took CSE 142 and 143 with him. Marty is the OG. I've never programmed before and got A's in both classes. He's not afraid to talk trash and makes fun of the annoying nerdy kids that always shout out the answers. Material is easy I just go to the lecture to see Marty. Looks and acts like Daniel Tosh. He knows his material and teaches it well.",
      "While Marty may be an awesome teacher, this is one of the hardest classes I have ever taken. Homework is highly challenging and takes forever to get it perfect. 50 minutes is way too short for the midterm. Not a well-designed class, IMHO. However, there is a lot of help if you need it. And it's hit or miss with the TA you get (they are undergrads).",
      "Hilarious and a fantastic teacher. I looked forward to every lecture!!!",
      "Marty's a really good teacher. Java is really hard but you have so many resources to learn the topic of the week: you can go to lecture, read the book, look at the slides, or watch the lecture online (what I did!). Also there are online practice problems. And an almost 24/7 computer lab dedicated to CSE students with TAs to help. Good, hard class.",
      "He's great at teaching java. If you're familiar with programming, this class is a joke. If not, pay attention and work hard and the resources available to you will get you the grade you desire. He's pretty funny too.",
      "Marty did his best to make the class interesting despite the dullness of his topic (procedural programming).",
      "Marty makes lectures really interesting, and he's really good at teaching all the concepts necessary to succeed for the class. Yes, his tests can be tricky, but he gives out a lot of practice problems, so you really know what to expect on those tests. Help is very available, so no worries if java's new to you.",
      "Awesome teacher; funny and interesting. Definitely take a class from him if you have a chance.",
      "Basically, your life is not complete until you take one of his classes. He's a great teacher and his lectures are both interesting and hilarious!!",
      "really fun, very informative!",
      "Marty rocks! He's really funny and makes it easy to learn Java. Keeps lectures interesting.",
      "Great teacher. Makes an effort to keep the class awake with some jokes. Really fast at responding to questions. Hard midterm and final but his practice tests help a lot.",
      "I had Marty for both CSE142 and CSE143. Personally, I liked the content of CSE143 better. His lectures are always helpful for completing hw assignments. His midterm and final are challenging, but his practice exams let you know what you're in for. He's by far one of the best UW teachers.",
      "Marty does an amazing job of making his lectures accessible not only while he's teaching them but after as well. His teaching style is humorous and his metaphors are apt. His homework isn't nitpicky; if you understand the concepts, they're a breeze. And if you go to lecture, he pretty much tells you exactly how to do it.",
      "Marty is a real funny guy and he would make fun of the TAs sometimes. This is my second quarter attending his lecture since CSE 142 and he's been great. I'm planning to sign up for CSE 190 next quarter which is also taught by him. Great guy. He did a good job teaching 143 for the first time",
      "Awesome. Marty might be the best professor UW has ever seen.",
      "For those who haven't programmed before, this class is extremely challenging. But Marty is a great teacher and his lectures are worth attending!",
      "Don't buy the textbook! But other than that, Marty is definitely the best teacher I've had so far. He is hilarious, his lectures are well setup and well developed, the homework is pretty clear, he had good office hours and good resources, he is the coolest teacher ever, and a geek at the same time so it's amazing. He is a funny genius.",
      "Most entertaining teacher I've ever had, he's really funny! He always took time to answer questions in class and gave helpful answers. His grading system was fair, and his lectures really prepared me for the homework. He also gives out helpful tips for the midterm and final, so make sure you attend class.",
      "Marty is one of the best teachers I've ever had. He's very straight forward and chill when he teaches. I recommend this class to everyone, whether they're interested in the major or just want to learn a bit of Java.",
      "I liked this guy because he always tried to stay on a low level with the students. He teaches knowing that most people have seen coding before (even tho he is a master at it), so he never seems annoyed that people don't even get the simplest concepts. I had the first UW class he taught, and he had the confidence to rap in front of us. Pretty cool.",
      "He's a good lecturer. Keeps students involved by asking questions. Humorous and keeps it interesting. Only con is that he seemed a little arrogant in person but I guess that's pretty irrelevant. Recommended.",
      "If you have to take CSE, take Marty!!!!!!! He is the best teacher I have ever had and I don't even like CSE. He is really good at understanding the material through a student's point of view and he explains things in a way that makes so much sense. He is also very consistent in the way that he writes and teaches programs which is important for CSE!",
      "Marty makes it interesting",
      "Don't know what to say.",
      "Intelligent, compassionate, challenging instructor. Also an inventive programmer",
      "Made class interesting each day and made you WANT to go to lecture because of how hilarious his teaching is.",
      "Marty Rules. Take his classes. Do it now.",
      "He's fantastic, period.",
      "His CSE142 class was so great (even though I didn't do so great grade-wise) that I took his CSE190m class as well. His teaching style is to the point, VERY humorous (though this may depend on person), and he doesn't rely heavily on slides. He's a very down-to-earth guy; I have IM'd him for questions a few times and he has helped me a ton.",
      "VERY fun professor and made computer programming simple. The textbook and slides are not very helpful except for reference, but if you attend all lectures and QS's you will do great. TAKE HIM if you have the opportunity.",
      "He's a pretty funny guy. Really knowledgeable. Because I never had any computer science experience before this class, it was a little rough at first. For me, class was mandatory in learning all the material. By the end I caught up though. Expect a lot of time invested in CSE142 if you haven't coded Java before.",
      "Where do I start&#63; Marty is a unique kind of guy. He is an expert programmer, writing text books for java, and it comes across in his teaching. I just loved his class, even though I struggled. He has an odd sense of humor, but he is very demanding and serious about programming. He teaches to the upper half of the class, so expect to work.",
      "Marty seems nice and funny when he is giving lectures but when you ask him a direct question he makes you feel like an Idiot and is not respectful to his students. I thought he was a good teacher but I believe I was wrong.",
      "His real name is Marty. He is awesome!! Really funny and dedicated to the subject. Fun class, lots of interesting assignments.",
      "This dude rocks! His lectures are great and even if you don't get it, he has good notes so don't worry. The only con is that he doesn't seem very approachable. When asking questions, I kind of had the feeling that I needed to rush because he got annoyed by how trivial my question was. Other than that he's coo. 9/10 prof",
      "great teacher, fun class.",
      "I've never taken any programming class before, but just going to lecture and listening (no notes) worked fine for me. Everything that's required for homework/midterms are explained well in lecture. Though if you miss class, notes are on the website. This might be hard for some people, but I think of this class as my fun class for this quarter.",
      "Great professor, explains concepts extremely well. Was always helpful. Assignments and tests are hard but fair. Loved his sense of humor! It added something that made me want to go to class every day.",
      "Marty is awesome. He makes the content easy to understand, even for people with 0 prior experience. He has plenty of tips for class resources, assigns interesting homework (it takes a while to finish, beware) and is always funny. He's my #1 recommendation for anyone wanting to take CSE142.",
      "Good lectures. The one class I actually looked forward to going to each day. Homework was very hard, especially since I am not going to be a CSE major. Plan lots of time for hw, like 8-10 hours for each one. And don't miss class. I missed a week cuz I was sick and fell waay behind. But other than that, a very good lecturer and an interesting class.",
      "Great at teaching the material and also pretty funny. Nonetheless, the class was one of the most difficult classes I've ever taken.",
      "This class was really hard for me, not having prior experience. However, Marty is so cool and ridiculously funny. Uses humor to make the class appealing. Best teacher I've ever had. Homework is tough so pay tons of attention in class.",
      "I definitely recommend this guy especially if this class is offered again. Even though he was learning the material a day before he taught, he did a very good job of structuring this class (new class and very experimental). He did a very good job at making the class fun and interesting the whole time. Very funny indeed.",
      "Textbook is technically optional, but exams are open-book & it's helpful w/assignments so buy it anyway! It's only required on MyUW b/c Marty gets $ as an author when you buy it. Lecture notes online are INCREDIBLY helpful - my favorite class this quarter. Lectures are entertaining and helpful. Homework gets tough around week 4/5...",
      "Really funny!",
      "An awesome teacher but the class is tons of work. definately reccomended if you have an interest in the subject he teaches eveything starting from the basics. loved the class!!!",
      "I loved this proffessor! I've always enjoyed coding, but I understand that most people find it very tedious. He tried really hard to make projects and lectures fun, and I always felt confident in my skills after a project. I highly recommend this professor to anyone with no previous coding experience.",
      "No Comments",
      "Nice guy, but unless you are going on to become a computer science major, expect to be in for a hard class. Definitely teaches towards those with prior computer programming experience.",
      "Marty is very helpful whenver in class or in office hour. He's very friendly and his class is very interesting. It's funny that he almost said something that he shouldn't have said when he was still a guest lecturer in summer 2005. It was funny.. I've heard he raps well too, apparently I had to miss it due to class.. so sad :(",
      "Great teacher. Very funny, great rapper. Knows what he is talking about and is very prepared. The assignments are challenging but not impossible.",
      "Awesome teacher. FUNNY! Really explains things in great detail. Very flexible in grading. LATE DAYS for homework assignments. Professor asks you how to improve the course, and then actually does it!",
      "I LOVED THIS CLASS & THE TEACHER!! If you have the opportunity to take this class with him as the teacher - take advantage of it! It is a lot of work but it makes it entertaining and worth while! Check out his facebook too!",
      "Unfortunately, I wasn't able to stay registered in his class, but from what I've seen thus far, he really cares about you as a student (probably because he was one himself only a few years back). When assigning homework, he will work on an in-class project very similar to what he had assigned, which makes it so much more easy and understandable.",
      "Although it is kind of weird having a prof who is younger than some of the students in the class, it is nice having one who is not yet jaded. He does a good job making the material very easy to understand and makes himself very accessible when a student needs assistance. Pretty funny to boot. :)"

      "One of the best computer science professors! His classes are incredibly difficult but worth it.",
      "Has the cutest doggie! Has extremely effective lectures and writes phenomenal tests, but can get a little snippy when stressed. Inventive apps are often buggy, but hey, that's what makes them fun and Adam human!",
      "Adam gives very interactive and inspiring lectures. He has tons of office hours and offers a lot of help online, too. His midterm this quarter was really tough, but he wrote a &quot;significantly easier&quot; final to make up for it. A very smart and caring prof indeed.",
      "What to say about Adam Blank? The best professor of my life. In the most different class I've ever taken, Adam made a dent in my education. Adam is just not only a talented professor, but also a great human being who believes in teaching as a life changing job he's up to. 311 is hard, but Adam will make it inspiring and really worth taking.",
      "Professor Blank works many extra hours to help students debug their homework and make sure they understand the material. And you can tell that he truly cares about his students. His lecture is extremely well planned and you could benefit from every minute of it.",
      "Better than the average UW CSE professor. By the ways, a lot of them suck. He's good at teaching. Achieved through a lot of interactive lectures and yelling during class &quot;Got it?!!?&quot;.",
      "One of the best teachers I've ever had! He encourages all of his students to work together during lectures on solving difficult problems, so we get practice working on the material. I recommend always going to class, because he cover a lot of material very quickly, and lectures are not recorded. Ask questions if you are confused and he will answer.",
      "CSE 311 is the hardest class I've ever taken but Adam was an absolutely amazing professor. His lectures were well organized and full of meaningful content, and he structures his lectures so that his students' focus is maximized. There are always office hours, and he encourages students to reach out for help whenever they need it.",
      "Adam's great. The class is difficult and he does go pretty quick but he is a very engaging lecturer. I'd take as many classes as I can with Adam if I could.",
      "Adam is amazing. Very energetic and dedicated to giving engaging lectures. Course structure was great, very well organized. He cares about his students and it shows. There's not much to say. Take him!",
      "He is one of the best professors in the department! if you could, I would recommend taking a class with him and you will love CSE MUCH MORE!",
      "If you hold a grain of respect to your education, take the class you're thinking about taking with Adam. I had him for both 143 and 332. Adam is a professor who pushes you to learn more than you ever would have normally, and does it in the best way possible. He is inspirational, and truly does care about his students' education more than anyone.",
      "Adam is very accessible outside class. Go to office hours! He's very willing to answer questions regarding handouts, HW and even CSE major planning. Our TA wasn't so helpful though. Grading criteria is very harsh, but that's 143's tradition. Adam tries to cover as much info as possible, so don't interrupt him by show off yourself during lecture.",
      "Very clear, very helpful. Homework grading can be harsh, but that's not his fault and as long as you spend time on the homework and exams you'll be fine. Exams are clearer and a bit easier than other lecturers' (in comparison to the sample exams). Got a 4.0 at last.",
      "I wish I could take every one of my CSE classes with this guy. Just an amazing professor.",
      "Adam's (prefers to be addressed this way rather than \"Prof. Blank\") lectures are entertaining, funny, and engaging. He aims to engage students and strongly encourages students to ask questions. Loves having people visit during office hours. Only one homework assignment per week. Best prof. I could've asked for in my first term. Strongly recommend.",
      "Of all the professors I've had, he by far cares the most about his students, and not just about if they pass/learn. I learned more from this class than I have from any other. Best professor I've ever had.",
      "Adam's one of the best, most considerate and caring professors I've ever had at UW. Really enthusiastic about the class and always goes out of his way to provide help for students.",
      "The best lecturer ever.",
      "Best prof ever, love him.",
      "Definitely the most caring professor I have ever had not just in UW, but in my life. He clearly cared a lot, like seriously, a lot about his students. When you are in the class, you will probably hate him so much for all the work and hard tests, but in the end, you will thank you so much because you have learned so much.",
      "Adam cares about his students more than any other teacher I have ever had - and it shows. All of the work (while there is a LOT) was reasonable and every assignment felt like a lot of thought went into it. Definitely try to take this class (or 311) with Adam.",
      "I have never met a professor that cares so much about his students. He sincerely wants the best for you and wants you to succeed. He gives random pep talks during lecture, simply for the sake of encouraging his students to believe in themselves. His dedication and passion made this class worth taking. (Also, it's an incredibly helpful class!)",
      "One of the best lecturers I've had, and hands down the most dedicated teacher I've had in my life. Clearly cares about your learning and is incredibly enthusiastic. Tons of work but it's mostly useful. However, I thought his exams were brutal. Gave us 90 minutes for a \"50 min exam\", no one finished early (decent median though). Overall a 10/10 prof",
      "Adam was an amazing lecturer. Do not recommend skipping any lectures. He gets you excited for the material, but grading can be really harsh and with a curve. TAs don't really care too much and are less likely to help. But Adam will answer emails and is pretty good with office hours and help. Don't ask obvious questions or try to show off.",
      "Fantastic prof. Hilarious but brilliant. He's also really young, and manages to connect with the students while still maintaining order and a sense of control. Definitely one of the best professors I've had in college.",
      "He's really hyper and bouncy and his lectures are a lot of fun. He really tries to make the class feel small and get students actively participating throughout the lecture. Some of his classes had everyone in a laughing fit for the entire 50 minutes. Tests are hard but he tells you exactly what to expect on them.",
      "one of the best professors around",
      "Amazing lecturer, hilarious, and incredibly enthusiastic about what he does. He's always willing to take feedback from students, and he really, truly does care about their success. I would definitely take this class again in a heartbeat. NOTE: yes, the programming assignments and exams are graded harshly, but that's UW CSE for you.",
      "Super enthusiastic. Swears. Overall amusing.",
      "He is such a good teacher",
      "Adam's the best professor I've had at UW. His lectures are entertaining and super helpful, and he is very passionate about teaching. Absolutely recommend. I'm not the most naturally gifted programmer, but I worked super hard for a 3.5 in this class and enjoyed it because of how great Adam is.",
      "Adam really is a fantastic lecturer. I really enjoyed his explanations and passion for computer science. The tests were slightly difficult, but I learned a lot.",
      "Adam is one of the best Instructors I've ever had. He passionately wants every one of his students to succeed, going out his way to provide good examples and create new resources to help. He is also a very entertaining lecturer, which helps for some of the tougher concepts.",
      "Adam is such a great teacher! I really loved him. He's passionate and explains the concepts pretty well for such a tough subject. The class is hard but he made it very enjoyable. He loves his students, is really helpful, and tries to make a big lecture hall feel small. I can't wait to have him again.",
      "Good lecturer; he's obviously very passionate about what he does. Sometimes a little confusing, but he's super helpful.",
      "He is a BIG kid that knows coding well!!",
      "One of my favorite classes last quarter. Adam always made time for students, and was extremely helpful and responsive when it came to arranging office hours or giving feedbackhelp. PowerPoints were always really nice and colorful. Lots of interaction in lecture, so you're not bored, and there was always someone you could ask for help.",
      "Adam is a new prof at UW but he tries very hard to improve and help. He is hands down better than Obourn. He gives good lectures and explanations most of the time, but sometimes he will overcomplicate things. He is no Stuart, but he is pretty good. CLEAR choice over Allison, I've been to both sections.",
      "Adam's a fun professor, but the class itself is bloody hard and the grading is VERY strict",
      "Adam's lectures are fun and all, but I was confused quite often. That said, he's really enthusiastic about teaching, and it shows. Goes out of his way to help.",
      "He is very passionate about cse and its shows. He asks for feedback during lectures a lot, and will spend more time on subjects if he needs to. Class is never boring and his excitement is pretty infectious.",
      "Adam is a new lecturer for this course but you can tell that he knows what he's talking about and he always makes lectures entertaining and fun. Very frequently available for help, whether it be before or after lecture or at office hours.",
      "Adam is such a passionate, helpful and friendly lecturer! Really, REALLY cares about making sure all students know the material and works really hard to provide opportunities for people to get help if they need it.",
      "Great engaging lecturer, finds creative ways to keep the class interesting such as having the TAs throw rubber ducks at you in lecture",
      "Adam really cares about his students! He's very funny and always loves to interact. Very funny and inspirational! I love this teacher."

      "I really like Hal's lecture style. He's entertaining in class, friendly with students, and explains things well. He discourages electronics during class (which is a plus in my opinion, might not be for you). Sometimes he moves a little fast especially if you're taking notes, and if you miss lecture it can be hard to catch up.",
      "Hal Perkins is a seasoned professor who cares about his students and the material he is teaching. He tries hard to make class fun and interesting, and is the first to admit when he makes a mistake. His assignments can be numerous and challenging - sometimes more than seems necessary. Start early with anything and everything you can.",
      "A lot of people complain about his no electronics policy. This really wasn't a big deal. the CSE 333 lecture pace never left us bored. Hal has taught CSE 333 for years and it shows. He's extremely knowledgeable and cares deeply about getting students involved",
      "Class was pretty difficult but fair. Midterms and final were pretty much the commands and syntax that you used on the homework. Lectures were pretty average.",
      "Hal is very good at lecturing. He gives examples and explains thoroughly so I can understand complex material.",
      "Hal tells tons of jokes in lectures. His exams are really nice. The 2-hour final is even shorter than the 1-hour midterm. The homeworks really take a lot of time, and homework grading is rather tough, but the TAs give good feedback. Homeworks were graded quickly so we always got feedback before the next assignment was due. Take 331 with Perkins!",
      "There's no office hours for this professor, but if you take the initiative to reach out to him, he'll definitely make time for you. His lectures are boring and dry, but his slides are really nice for reviewing. He also provides lots of practice midterms and finals.",
      "Perkins is very passionate about learning, although his lectures do go a bit slow. Always tons of hw, but that's where the learning happens. Tests are formatted almost exactly like previous years, which makes them much easier to prepare for",
      "Really boring but good teacher and clear requirements. Going to class is definitely not needed. I respect this guy he cares about his teaching",
      "Hal is a great professor. He comes up with really hands-on assignments and encourages actually writing high-quality code -- not just talking about it.",
      "Cool dude. Writes clear tests. Definitely recommend",
      "Best teacher in the world! The only teacher so far that is worth my tuition. I'm currently taking 333 with him, and I'm very happy!",
      "Programming Languages - difficult class, but I learned alot and he was always willing to seek out answers he did not know. He doesn't pretend to know things that he does not.",
      "I had him for CSE 410 and 413. He is a humorous lecturer. He makes lectures fun and interesting, and is able to explain things clearly (this might have something to do with the fact that he doesn't come across as a field expert). It's almost like he knows just enough to teach off the slides (which he didn't write). long homeworks, moderate exams.",
      "What I like about Hal is that he's a lecturer, not a research prof, so he can actually teach. He kept classes engaging and was always ready with more in depth explanations when needed. Also, at least for 378 he's not exactly an expert in the subject, but this is good because he's more able to explain things to someone who doesn't know anything",
      "Hal is nice and helpful. He has a peculiar style but otherwise a great teacher (and super easy).",
      "I don't know about introductory courses, but I found Hal to be very clear in 326, which is Data Structures. I think he assumes you're prepared for the course, so if you're hoping to coast forget it. However, he's extremely helpful if you approach him. I'd take another course from him.",
      "Awesome lectures, very interesting even though he might not delve fully into some topics (but it is an intro course, so that makes sense). Extremely friendly and helpful in person. I skip a lot of lectures in my other classes, but I made it a point to never miss Hal's because they were so great. And at least he knows the jokes aren't funny...",

      "Very knowledgable prof. Wish I could say the same as my TA, but perkins did a great job with the course and even through in some really bad jokes.",
      "I thought his explanations were clear and he tried to explain things in a way so non computer geeks could understand.",
      "He tried to have a sense of humor, but it never worked not because we're comp nerds, but his jokes simply weren't funny...Besides this he's a easy prof for programming class. midterms were fairly easy.",
      "A lot of people in CS 142/143 are supernerds and have been doing this stuff forever. Those are the people that say Perkins is too easy. He's a great prof, uses lots of examples, and a good communicator, unlike many computer science professors.",

She is very clear and makes you genuinely interested in computer science and I found myself actually enjoying lecture and the homework projects. You're expected to show up and work hard but lectures are informative and you learn a lot of great concepts about CS.",
      "142143 is pretty regulated to a median 3.0. Her teaching is great, she is very enthusiastic and uses powerpoint. If you like handwritten overheads, then take Reges. Do well on the homework, check for style.",
      "Helene is super sweet, enthusiastic about the material, and overall an awesome person. Totally willing to answer any questions and such.",
      "LN is a great lecturer. I came in to CSE 142 with literally zero experience of programming before, and never thought that I would become so interested in computer science now. I took her 142 course last quarter, and she was one the main reasons why I continued to take CSE 143 this quarter. She is super super nice and humorous! Super great teacher!",
      "I came in with zero programming experience and no expectations but LN's teaching encouraged me to take 143 as well with her this quarter. Her lectures are interesting and if you miss something you can always re-watch the recorded lecture online. Read the TA's grading standards and proofread your HW. Do 5-10 practice exams before each test.",
      "Love her enthusiasm when teaching, it really is contagious! (: Started my first day with no programming experience whatsoever and now I'm hooked on learning more (currently taking CSE 143.) Weekly projects can be a bit time-consuming and frustrating but the outcome is well worth it. If you're curious about CSE, Helene is the way to go!",
      "I'm a senior from the mechanical engineering department.Taking the class to a bit about java.My opinion this class is time consuming. Work load is not a 4credit class at all.I have learned other languages before but I don't think the time I have spent so far for this class was reasonable. Sections shouldn't mandatory for grades.She's nice though.",
      "Good lecturer and very conscientious and caring teacher. The class is very hard though if you haven't done programming before, and very time consuming.",
      "I came into CSE 142 already taking Java for 3 years. It was a bit easy, but I never liked CS before taking her class, and now I absolutely love it, and I'm considering majoring in it. If people say she's not helpful or clear, the IPL really helped me out and office hours.",
      "This class was great, and even inspired me to possibly major in CSE. Helene is great, full of energy, and always willing to answer any question. Great class, the homework is tricky but there is a lab to get help every day. Take this class!",
      "I think she is a great professor. makes the class interesting and makes the coursework seem logically developed and clear. INASNELY TOUGH MIDTERMS AND FINALS TOUGH. Take the class if its with her, better than the other professors",
      "If you aren't taking CSE142/143 with her, you are doing it wrong.",
      "Awesome teacher! It was my first time doing Java and I expected it to be impossibly hard but Helene ensured that we were continuously motivated. Lectures are full of energy and I was always looking forward to them.",
      "She's great! Loved her for CSE 143--highly recommended. However, if you're not in love with CS and willing to spend time on the homework, you're gonna have a bad time.",
      "Highly recommend to attend her lecture if you are willing to major in CSE. Her lecture gives students interest and knowledge about CSE. However exams and homeworks are super-tough!! You should know that",
      "The material is difficult if you're not technically inclined. However, if you're taking this class, you want to take it with Helene. She's passionate about the material, entertaining in her presentation, and always willing to take a moment to explain things. I tend not to get much from lectures, but her lectures are worth attending.",
      "She's awesome! The people that rated her poorly because of the work clearly don't understand the way classes work at UW--about 10 hours of work per week is what is expected for a 5-credit class. She's super enthusiastic and available, and really knows her stuff. Highly recommended",
      "So-so teacher, but very enthusiastic. Classes were fun.",
      "Highly recommend! Absolutely loved this class. I came in with zero knowledge of this subject and feel like I learned a whole bunch this quarter. Homework is not always easy but it feels great when you complete it and makes you feel like you actually learned. Take Helene Martin if you get the chance!",
      "LOVED THIS CLASS! Most will find it challenging unless very comp/tech savvy. I'm not comp savvy, but I love puzzles, so this class was super fun! Hard at times, but rewarding! Helene is kind, intelligent and helpful! Her solutions are so concise & eloquent, it's art! Use them to do the HW! Use Practice-It to study for exams, copy her program style!",
      "LOVED this class! Most will find it to be challenging unless they have programmed b4 or are comp/tech savvy. That said, I am not one of those people, but I love puzzles so this class was SUPER FUN! Helene is wonderful, kind and helpful! Her code solutions are so concise and eloquent it's art! Apply them to the HW! HW was totally reasonable! Study!",
      "Helene is a fantastic instructor. She explains all the material very thoroughly and makes every detail of her examples very clear. If you are good at thinking with algorithms, you'll do fine in this class. If not, you may need to spend a little extra time reading/practicing.",
      "Helene is amazing! She is incredibly helpful, and is especially supportive of autodidacts and people outside the CSE major. I can't recommend her strongly enough!",
      "Do not, I repeat, do not, take this class if you aren't 100% interested in CSE. This is a weed out class, and you won't get above a 3.5, even a 3.0 if you don't invest a LOT of time into understanding what is going on.",
      "Great professor. The material, exams, and homework is hard, but she probably does the best anyone can. I haven't had Marty or Stuart, but Helene is definitely a great professor.",
      "Very intelligent, very enthusiastic, very amazing prof!",
      "Ln does a really good job encouraging participation during lectures. Because of this, Lectures weren't boring and I was able to learn a lot. She takes the class into some deeper material that isn't required but is really interesting. I recommend her as a professor.",
      "She's great, I had her for CSE 142 and now CSE 143. Very put together, comprehensive lectures I don't actually fall asleep in, does a great job putting all of her demos and notes online, all well formatted and working, and if you are a girl looking to go into CSE who feels intimidated, go talk to her, she's very supportive and friendly.",
      "LN is a great teacher, she explains the ideas really well. She's nice and very helpful if you go to office hours. The homework is great if you like programming, but could be hard if you've never done it before. LN is good at going over everything in lecture though so if you don't skip you should be OK.",
      "This was her first quarter teaching at the university level; before she was a high school teacher, and it shows. But not necessarily in a bad way. She's very energetic and enthusiastic about CSE, and explains it well. She herself was an undergraduate in CSE at the UW and was head TA here. The class was good and I found the homeworks interesting."

Be ready to work a long time on homework and study for tests.",

It doesn't feel like I'm wasting my time doing busy work and a lot of concepts are applicable to tests. Test problems are hard, but workable if you spent supple time on the homework.",
      "By far the best professor I've had at UW. Lectures are amazing, she teaches cs in a clear, concise manner, and she makes lectures really interesting and funny. The exams and homework are very fair but also pretty hard. Also provides fantastic study material online. Overall 15/10 :)",
      "Zorah's a great lecturer for CS142 and 143! Watch Panapto recordings instead on your time at your own pace (you can go back, re-watch stuff, etc...). Assignments and tests are great for learning, but insanely difficult, expect a low grade. However as an elective to learn the tools of programming, if you are an engineering student, unbeatable!",
      "Zorah is a great lecturer. The CSE intro classes are difficult, but if you put in the work, you will get a good grade. Zorah provides all of the necessary resources for her students to be successful, and truly wants them to do well. I'd never programmed before taking 142, and I did fine. Now I'm taking 143 with Zorah and loving it.",
      "Amazing professor - Zorah explains concepts really well, she's friendly and approachable. Super hard though - came in with no experience and the material was too hard to grasp quick enough for the homework/exams. Not for beginners. You'll succeed if you know the basics of java before coming in.",
      "Prof. Zorah is really bubbly and nice! Her lectures were easy to understand and fun. She always included cute pictures of animals in her lectures as \"mental breaks\". She is also very understanding and generous on the grades for the midterm and final. Great professor!",
      "I was initially scared at taking 142 without prior programming experience, but Zorah's class is very structured, & I've done well in it. I enjoy her cat/dog pictures. She seems to understand our generation more, because she's younger. She's very enthusiastic & wants every student to succeed, whether they're a Direct Admit or not even a CS major.",
      "Zorah is a great lecturer. She does a good job of explaining concepts and will stop to check for questions. Lectures are very enjoyable with her jokes and pictures of dogs and cats (: Super up-beat attitude that will keep you engaged.",

      "Super hot, fun class",
      "Zorah was honestly a really good lecturer. Despite being distracted by her cuteness, I was able to learn all that I needed to succeed in her lectures. She always explained difficult concepts clearly and made lecture bearable with her terrible jokes. She was very helpful during office hours as well :) Would def take again for more reasons than one:)",
      "Great prof for CSE 143. Though all the professors at the CSE dept. are very apt. Zorah was great to listen to (and watch ;-)) at lectures. She's very respected by students because she earned her masters from UW in 5 years in CS. If you can take this class make sure to take it with Zorah.",
      "I had Zorah for 142 and 143. 142 she was super amazing and 100% prepared for every question. This was her first quarter teaching 143 so ofc she was less prepared for every question that came up but still did a great job teaching concepts and generating analogies. Really relatable and really inspirational as an intelligent woman in stem.",
      "Great lecturer and person. Always very happy and seems to love teaching and always has great answers to questions. Course content can be difficult at times but she is able to explain stuff very well.",
      "Very engaging lecturer, but isn't always able to stay on schedule. If lecture falls behind a day, homework and discussion section continues on at the regular schedule anyway. Homework and exams are actually fun. You don't actually need the textbook; I did the whole class with just Oracle's online Java documentation, never needed the text.",
      "Zorah is a fantastic teacher. She has sympathy for those who have never had coding experience and will reach out to you if you ask for help. She also understands our generation of kids have pretty limited attention spans, so will make sure to keep lecture interesting. CS 142 was a blast with her. If you do lots of practice it, you'll be fine.",
      "Zorah is a great teacher with a cute personality. She knows her stuff. Sometimes I wouldn't go to lecture though because I already knew the material and she'd spend half the time reviewing the last lecture, which is good if you are new to the material. The homework will make or break you. The tests are reasonable.",
      "Zorah is a wonderful professor! She explains everything incredibly well, and really does make CS fun! She is a tough grader, and her exams are quite tough at times in the way that they are not very straight forward. At first glance the programming problems seem easy, however, they are much more complicated in reality (Final).",
      "Attend lectures. They are very helpful. Homeworks are easy to understand. Tests are relatively easy. She is helpful and entertains questions in class as well as during office hours. You will have fun.",

      "Tough class, if you have no coding experience. Be ready to sweat, lectures make it seem like the concept is easy to grasp then once you get the homework its like you got smacked with a sludge hammer. Home work is tough, midterms/finals will make you cry. Grades are curved though the class has many who have coding experience so don't expect mercy!",

      "best CSE professor at UW ever",
      "Yes!!",
      "She is amazing. Best ever!",
      "I took 142 with her and it was fun. She was really cool. Definitely prefer Zorah over Stuart. He only cared about the DA's or it seemed that way whereas Zorah was always encouraging everyone :) Do a lot of practice it problems and the TA sessions help.",
      "Have not had her but just want to say she looks really really cute!! Wish I had her :P",
      "She was great at explaining concepts and an overall pleasant person. But when asking for help, I felt she was a bit distant and snobbish. Other than that though, the class was generally pretty fun and assignments were cool.",

      "He's a fine instructor. The lecture slides, homework, and format of exams are always recycled from previous quarters, which is expected for a course like this. Your grade in this class will be a reflection of how much effort you put into it. There are so many resources available that it's your fault an no one else's if you don't succeed.",
      "Benson was a great lecturer. Easy to follow along. Definitely a stickler for grading though especially homework assignments. Can be inconsistent from one TA to another. If you have the time to dedicate to the class, you will do well.",
      "I had no programming experience prior to taking the class. Still 4.0ed the class. Benson is a great teacher. Very quick in responding to questions, speaks clearly, and does a great job at keeping the class entertaining. Go to lecture, spend time on homework, and practice previous midterms and finals and the class is not too hard!",
      "I just loved his teaching style. He really makes you interested in the subject. Every question I asked got an immediate answer on the message board. Very efficient. I wish he could teach CSE 143!",
      "I must say that I learned a lot in this class, although I am not a CSE major. Homeworks are 50% of your grade, and if you really do them by yourself, it will help you a lot during the midterm and the final. Come to quiz sections as your TA will give you cheat sheets every week. As long as you have a grade above the mean, you'll get at least a 3.5.",
      "Good teacher. Cares about the subject quite a bit and communicates ideas effectively. He definitely stimulated my interest in the subject and kept the class mighty entertaining. That said, he gave by far the hardest final of my life. Class average was a 49. More than 10 pages. Nobody finished.",
      "SO AWESOME. Totally on top of his stuff. The most &quot;plugged in&quot; class I've ever taken. There's a wealth of resources available to his students. Also, super funny. Do your reading and actually study and you'll do just fine.",

      "Benson was, without a doubt, the best CS teacher I have taken a class with. He clearly understands the material he is teaching, and presents it in a way that is accessible to the students. As for those who have said he does not let you collaborate on assignments, this is not the case. It is a departmental policy that he had to enforce.",
      "i went to the class everyday cuz of him, he is the hottest the best prof i ever had",
      "I learned a lot through this class. He is a considerable teacher who cares a lot about his students. He is so professional that he tries to clarify everything he taught in class to his students. This class is the best class I have so far. It is really interesting and useful especially for those who want to learn the basic knowledge about computer.",
      "This guy actually is my favorite professor thus far in UW. It's disheartening to see all the bad comments about him, because I don't see how any of it is true. He's a funny guy who keeps us entertained with funny videos at the beginning of class. We were suppose to be taught by a much easy teacher WIN2009, but I'm glad Benson taught us instead!",
      "One of the best professors I've ever had. Plays music and videos before class. I had no previous programming experience but could still do all the homework alone w/out any help. Got a 3.6 GPA. Easy class structure. He brought a robot he built to class once. His class has helped me find what I want to major in. But beware, may try to rick-roll you.",
      "He's one of the best professor I've ever had. He is extremely clear with his lecture and makes computer programming fun! His exams can be sometimes hard, though I believe it's the CS faculty that writes the exams.",
      "He is one of the nicest ,easy and hardworking professors who do all they can to give out the knowledge they know",
      "He is a very excellent professor, the best I have been taught in my University until now.",
      "He is good teacher",
      "Very clear, entertaining.",
      "Benson is a cool teacher. He plays music before class and tells jokes that are somewhat corny, but still funny. He is very interested in making sure all of his students understand the coursework and is always available to help.",

      "It is amazing that Hunter can give such great lectures and cover a lot of useful libraries and skills in data science considering this is the first offering of CSE 163. He is accessible outside class and responsive to student questions on Piazza. Values feedbacks from students and cares a lot about student learning. Cute animal gifs are the best!",
      "Hunter was born to teach. He goes to teaching conferences and employs proven methods to his teaching methodology. He truly cares about his students and strives to help everyone. I don't know how he does it, but he makes time for you outside of class if you request it and I'm truly grateful for him!",
      "Hunter is one of the best teachers I have had the pleasure of learning from. He makes complex topics understandable, and gives good very clear lectures and instructions. He really cares about his teaching and if students are learning. I can't say enough good things about him. The CSE 163 class is one that he designed and it is awesome, TAKE IT!",
      "Hunter's lectures are very clear, he makes good examples, uses Polleverywhere for class engagement, and even has a sense of humor. However, the grading scale for homework/tests isn't always so clear and can be frustrating. Go to section, practice a lot, and talk to your TA/go to Hunter's office hours if you want a high grade in this class.",
      "CS at UW is kind of horrible if you aren't a CS genius, but Hunter made things very inclusive during lecture. He was very careful to act like he didn't know what was going on all the time which really changes the tone in such a competitive class. If you like your GPA I don't recommend CS though.",
      "I really enjoyed his class. I see that others might have marked him down but honestly, you need to put in the grit to reap the reward. I suspect his lower score is due to students expecting an easier time in class even if they know how to program which is an easy mistake. You need to perform well on the homework and tests to succeed.",
      "He is a great teacher.",
      "Clear lectures introducing content in an easy to understand way. Don't listen to these other hater reviews, as many blame Hunter for their own incompetence. Eight homeworks much like 142, and the midterm tends to be on the easier side, and the final is much longer and more difficult. Homework grade is dependent on your TA, and style is focused on.",
      "He is really a genius! Both of analogy and explanation. One homework per week. Not huge workload compared to other science classes. The only drawback might be he is so cute that you may pay all attention to him himself instead of what he is teaching.",
      "One of the best lecturers in UW! He gives a lot of examples in class which really made it easier to understand concepts. His lectures are fun. He genuinely cares about his students' feedbacks. Also a lot of pics of super cute puppies.",
      "Hunter is a great lecturer. He gives pretty clear examples in class and is very patient explaining problems during office hours as well. He encourages student participation and encourages group discussion using poll questions. Also showed tons of cute gifs throughout the quarter and values feedback from students.",
      "Good lectures, great guy. The grading for the class was rough at times but fair (prioritize good comments!). Attendance is optional, all lectures are online, but I would recommend watching them in person with laptop closed, phone away.",
      "This was my favorite class at UW so far. He makes funny jokes during lectures but teaches the material really well. The homework assignments are fun and give you a lot of freedom. He makes it really clear what's on the test and what's not and gives a lot of resources to study.",
      "clear and concise",
      "fun teacher, enthusiasm for material and teaching was infectious",
      "Humorous lecturer. Clear and patient explanations.",
      "Hunter #1 TA. If he is your TA, you will be golden (church).",
      "Literally the best TA I've had at UW. Patient, explained things WAY more clearly than the professor did, would have failed this class if it were not for Hunter. He's the man!",
      "Awesome TA. Seriously one of the nicest most patient people I have ever met let alone among teachers.",
      "Hunter was the bomb! He inspired me to get into computer science. His lectures were clear and concise, allowed people to ask questions as he was coding, and had a casual feel to the section. He's got a great smile and laugh, and if you see him around campus he's super friendly! Too bad I didn't have him for 143. :("

      "Having never taken a CSE course before I was afraid of doing poorly, especially at UW. Wortzman taught high school for many years and really knows how to cater to beginners and experienced students. He was uplifting and stressed that your effort, not your past experience, was how you could get a good grade. Fantastic lectures and clear criteria.",
      "Best lecturer ever! Brett explains things extremely well and is very open to everyone's questions even when he has a class of 720. Do yourself a favor and take his class!!",
      "Attend lectures and you will be fine,",
      "He is solid for 142, and many of his tests can be easy but require you to dump a lot of time into studying for them, and they are graded quite harsh and you won't really see your errors. Class overall is lecture heavy, and if you pay attention you should be fine. One thing that sucks however is the release of homework and the due dates are awkward.",
      "The hardest course I've taken in my first quarter of college. Big amount of workload. It's hard, but if you are willing to spend time on practicing you'll be fine. I actually enjoy the process of learning CSE but it's actually hard to get a high score. BTW I feel sooo sleepy in Kane Hall during his lectures. Every single time.",
      "Brett's a nice guy. I come in blind and learned so much. Attendance isn't mandatory (large class) but I recommend going, as panopto takes time to upload. Be careful w/ hw assignments--check style guide and basically any resource available to you. Doing practiceit before exams rly helps, but start early. The system crashes when everyone's using it.",
      "Is able to take the basic concepts they teach in CSE 142 and make them somewhat interesting. Overall, I dislike CSE 142 --- I think grading is pretty subjective depending on your TA, they make a lot of errors in grading, there are a lot of curveballs on the tests, and it's just generally somewhat stressful. Brett--still great, but the class sucks",
      "Brett is easily the best lecturer I have ever listened to before. Each lecture is extremely clear and well-thought through. He knows the subject like the back of his hand and knows how to engage the class so that they pay attention.",
      "Great great lecturer. Very interactive. Codes in his lectures so we can learn alongside. Knows his stuff. Gives great answers to student questions. Good experience overall.",
      "Brett's awesome. He really knows his stuff and I can tell he really loves what he does. Would love to be able to take more classes with him, he makes it really fun!",
      "Really good!",
      "I came into this class with no prior knowledge, and Brett did a great job of explaining everything so I could easily understand it. Assignments are time consuming but they are fun and we only have one assignment each week. Exams and really difficult, but Brett and TAs tell you exactly what to expect.",
      "The CSE 142/143/143x series at UW is a well oiled machine and Wortzman is no exception. The lectures and homeworks were all pre-written by Reges and Stepp, so Wortzman mainly just regurgitates these materials which is fine since the materials are clear and cater to the individual with no prior programing experience.",
      "Brett is a great professor. You would be lucky to take his class especially when you are new to programming like me. He teaches everything clearly and gives a lot of examples. He posts the programs he used in lectures online for you to review later. Also, he is humorous.",
      "You will have an amazing time if you take CSE142 with Brett. The class is hard especially if you are new to computer programming like I was. Attend lectures and quiz sections and you will do just fine. Plenty of resources to get help from, and most of the TAs are very smart and caring. His lectures are fun and easy to follow.",
      "Amazing lecturer!!! He genuinely cares about his students! He is always so passionate in class. Love him.",
      "Amazing professor! Made the accelerated intro class material super understandable, albeit the departmental grading system made the class as a whole much more difficult. Would recommend him highly.",
      "Need to take CSE 142? Do yourself a favor by taking it with Brett! Not only is he knowledgeable, but he is by far one of the most affable professors you can possibly have at UW. His tests tend to be on the more challenging side, but he is super helpful with answering questions after lecture and during office hours.",
      "All I can say is wow. Mr. Wortzman is one of the best teachers I have ever had. I came in with 0 coding experience and decided to take this class for fun. I'm so happy I did. He does an excellent job of breaking down the hardest java topics into easy-to-understand pieces, loves answering questions, and truly cares about his students. 10/10",
      "One of the best lecturers I've ever had. Engaging, super patient with questions, and is very organized in course material. I barely cracked the textbook open because he explains everything so well!",
      "143X goes over tons of material in a short amount of time, and Brett does a great job of keeping the class on track. Great explanations. Read the book before lectures and ask questions during office hours to solidify your knowledge and make debugging easy. Generous curve so an easy 4.0 if you do well on the final.",
      "He. Is. AWESOME! Super interesting and clear lectures, always open to any types of questions, talks at just the right pace. Tests are challenging but fair. He is extremely helpful if you go to his office hours, I couldn't reccomend using those enough. You can tell this guy knows what he is doing and is very passionate about CS. A+ prof"

It wasn't that bad, so I felt like I learned a lot. She's a great lecturer and gives TONS of feedback about your personal assignment and the assignment in general. She really cares about you.",

I'm really glad I had the opportunity to learn from her, and I hope I can take another course with her again some time! There is a moderate amount of work in this class, so stay on top of assignments and you'll be fine. Don't try to do them in a day!",
      "The thing I really appreciate about Ruth is how clear she is with expectations, and always wanting students feedback to become better at teaching the material. She's not the most exciting teacher but that being said, I really loved having her as one just because I knew she was super open to students and wouldn't try and hide any expectations.",
      "Great professor, really clear in lectures and energetic. Very approachable and open to students asking questions, but much better at answering questions in 1 on 1 rather than in lecture. 332: Weekly homeworks (easy) and three large projects (hard), make sure to stay on top of the projects as it's incredibly hard to do them well at the last minute!",

Was very clear about the material, went through a lot (but not too many) examples and homework was extremely relevant to the tests, unlike some other classes. Very helpful and enthusiastic, would definitely take another class with her again.",
      "Ruth is amazingly approachable and a really great lecturer. Talks about tradeoffs really well and has a nice way of asking and answering questions. Also helpful during office hours and seems pretty overall cool!",
      "Man she was great! Really clear, and easy to follow lectures.",
      "One of the best professors in the UW CSE department. You can really tell that the students like her. Even for a class with terribly boring material, she does a great job of explaining and her enthusiasm definitely shows. Not many professors that care about their students as much as Ruth.",
      "Can take time to warm up to. She responds to emails. Has practice midterms/finals. They're similar to real things, but there are curve balls. Homework is very reasonable. The course had a lot of structure and you had time to complete assignments. The book was terrible. I would recommend this instructor for CSE 373.",
      "I'm also surprised to see her rated low. She's been very good -- not stellar or hugely exciting, but consistently clear, good homework assignments, easy exams.",
      "Surprised she has such a low rating! I found her to be very clear and sometimes a little funny, and I definitely learned a lot from this class. I would take a class from her again!",

      "Expert in the field, great lectures. Knows the material very very well. Awesome delivery of material. Very helpful and understanding. Always knows answers to all questions. Best professor I have ever had. Highly recommend taking a class from him!",
      "Knows the material and cares about his students. Lectures are clear, and he's accessible. A+++++ would learn from again",
      "He is an expert in the material he teaches and it shows from the way he presents the lectures. He is great at giving feedback and passionate about teaching. He cares a lot for the students and grades fairly. If you are a sincere student and care to understand/learn the material and not just get a good grade, he is the best professor to have.",
      "I really enjoyed his teaching style. He is probably the best lecturer I've had. Homework could definitely be time consuming, but there was a lot of help offered. He wrote very fair tests.",
      "Nice guy, very reasonable in workload and assignment design. And, unlike most CSE profs, SUPER PATIENT. Ask questions and you'll get your answers. Lectures could be organized about better.",
      "He's a chill guy, willing to help out if you ask for it. I wouldn't say that his lecture is the best I had at UW, but still he is one of the most nice profs to talk to if you encounter any problem outside of the class, or just talk to and expect some kind responses."

      "I did pretty well in the class until the final brought my grade down from a projected 3.7-3.8 to a 3.4. Just make sure you study really hard for the final and study for the midterm and final at least one to two weeks before hand and make sure you thoroughly check style on hw and then you can get at least a 3.5",
      "Riley is awesome! I had never coded before taking 142, and now I TA for it! Amazing class with an amazing prof, definitely would take again. Very informative lectures and very knowledgeable.",
      "Took it last year, but still go back and watch her lectures when I get confused on some concepts :) hard class but her lectures are $$$$",
      "Riley is a really good lecturer and very sweet. She really goes the distance to help make female students feel welcome in a very male dominated department. The class is hard, make sure you study for the tests at least a week in advance, but if you work hard and work with Riley/your TA you can get a good grade.",
      "Riley was an amazing lecturer. I took CSE 143 with her and she definitely knew what she was talking about. She had great slides and extremely useful office hours. Devoted to her students and their enjoyment in the info. She would make extra offices hours for students to talk about anything related to tech or more homework! IPL TAs were chosen well.",
      "Riley is a great lecturer. She understands millennials, and teaches with humorous references to keep the lecture interesting. Her enthusiasm and personality really make the course interesting. 142 is challenging as there are people retaking the course, therefore the averages are high. Riley is a great lecturer, so don't blame her for the averages!",
      "I was a bit skeptical at first since it was her first time teaching but she turned out to be amazing! Her lectures are really clear and answers all student questions. If you pay attention during lecture and practice, you should do well in the class.",
      "The introductory CS class at UW is a well-oiled machine; Riley's teaching is no less. She clearly and effectively delivers the material. Most of your personal interaction in this class is with the TAs in the IPL (Introductory Programming Lab). CSE142 lectures are recorded in Ponopto, so you technically don't NEED to go to class, but u prbly should.",
      "Great class, love Riley. Final and Homework is the focus of it all! Go to lecture and go to the IPL to perfect homeworks and study hard and you'll be good.",
      "New Professor for CSE 142, is just as good as Reges for the intro course. Midterm isn't super important, most of the grade comes from homework and final."

      "Honestly his class was my favorite class I have taken at UW. He is really energetic about all the material he talks about. The only bad thing is that the class itself was hard so the lectures were very fast paced. Also btw you don't need the textbook at all he has power points and they are posted online.",

      "Probably one of the best teachers I have ever had. He handwrites when he gives lectures so you can copy what he writes and follow along. The pacing is perfect to where you can understand everything that he is talking about. Tests and homework are completely based off of his lecture material.",
      "One of the best professors at UW. Clear and consistent pace in lectures. If you attend class and pay attentiontake notes, you'll probably do well. All of his tests are based off of material he covers in class.",
      "Hands down one of my favorite profs. Old school lecturing style, very engaging and thorough.",
      "Outstanding Professor. Uses the whiteboard as opposed to powerpoint, which I find very helpful in \"math\" classes. Had us learn a card game, Schnapsen, which was pretty cool. Despite what you may hear, it is very easy to learn. Though I can't say I enjoy probability, I did enjoy the way he taught it.",
      "Great prof, enjoyed his lectures and class. Tests were reasonable, only negative aspects in my view is that homework is weighted too heavily.",
      "Old School, articulate and very engaging. One of the best professors at UW, hands down. I was not interested in taking this course, but he made it a great experience.",
      "His class was easy... I would say too easy because average was well above 80% which made it so difficult to get a good grade since the class is curved. Amazing professor though! He is very helpful during his office hour.",
      "Great professor, elegant, clever, and fair. Also a one-of-a-kind sense of humor, loved his course.",
      "This guy is the most elite professor I have ever had. He can take the most convoluded student question, instantly clarify it in english, and then answer it in a second."

      "Kevin has a soothing and angel-like voice and his pitch is calming in that it usually goes really high up at the end of the sentence. I like him, but as for lecture, I do not understand anything and clearly I got annihilated by the tests. It is a hard class, and I don't think he does a good job teaching it.",
      "Kevin gets through the lecture material when he is supposed to and clearly has a deep understanding of all the topics covered in 311. At times it can be difficult to focus because he has a very smooth voice. The tests were moderately difficult but there was adequate preparatory material. Homework is very time consuming but it is possible to succeed",

It seems like he only teaches 331 in the summer, but maybe that will change. Pretty typical for CS at UW. Best class to take after CSE 143. I STRONGLY suggest you take this before 332, because it is useful.",
      "The course content was hard itself, but he gave clear and straight forward lectures. The exam questions were very often from his speech so COME TO CLASS (there was no recording).

He was a clear and good lecturer, and his exams were reasonable. Lecture is non-mandatory, but worth going to as he elaborates beyond the slides, and on their own the slides are somewhat difficult to understand",

None of the other 312 profs use R in this class, but the envy of your non-Ruzzo-fied peers is totally worth the quarter's worth of swearing fits. You'll think you are failing the class the entire quarter, only to discover that you did fine in the end."

She's also very knowledgeable about the class, don't be afraid to ask her questions!",
      "I really appreciate how much effort Ning put into making the quiz sections helpful and fun. Super grateful that she replied to emails very quickly too. CSE 143 has been the hardest class I've taken to date, so it was great having an AWESOME TA.",
      "Ning was excellent as a TA. She gave amazing help and advice on how to pass the exams as well as giving us pro tips on how to enter the CompSci major and for future job interviews. She deeply cares about her students and is easily accessible at all times, just shoot her an email and she's likely to respond within the next few hours.",
      "Ning is good at teaching the knowledge and she always used metaphors to make a clear point. She care about whether everyone understands the problem. After class, she responds my email really fast. Before the final, I asked her several questions and she always respond in only several minutes!!! She also brought food and candies for us :)",

I once e-mailed her a couple questions before the midterm, and she responded in like an hour with videos of her working out the problems on a white board just for me.",

She is very dedicated and is very clear with her explanations. She always makes sure the class knows what's going on and doesn't just tell the answer, but allows her students to figure it out.",

Also incredibly approachable and responds to emails super quick. (AND she brings goodies... incentive to do well because she cares about how well you do!)",

Outside class room she also replys emails really fast, caring all her students a lot. If you are going to take CSE class, select her section !!!",

She encourages her students to try their best and makes sure that all of her students are able to handle the material. She explains how the course material is used in real-world applications.",
      "Ning (goes by Isis) clearly has fun teaching, and it is reflected in the fun atmosphere of her lectures. She brings good energy to class, and sometimes snacks too. The lectures in this class (when I took it at least), were optional, but they were definitely worth going to."

I didn't go to many lectures, due to horrible sleep habits but the ones I did show up to were great. He takes time to get to know his students and make class interesting. If you take this class, GET KANTWON!!!!",
      "Kantwon is an amazing professor. For someone with little coding experience, this class was very challenging. Homework is very time consuming, but help desk is great. Work with others toward understanding. I did very poorly on the tests, but with final replacement, I was able to pull it up to a B. This is a very common experience. Don't lose hope.",
      "Definitely the best teacher I've had in my entire life. Not only is he a wonderful teacher, he's also a great person, and you can tell that he genuinely cares about you. He's inspired me to pick up a minor in CS, even though I had no programming experience before college. Make your schedule around this man's class because trust me, it's worth it.",
      "I attended Kantwon's lecture though I wasn't in his section. He is the best prof if you have no previous coding experience. Explains topics really well, focuses on the why behind each topic rather than just solutions to examples. This semester they stopped allowing students from other sections into his lecture and scan Buzzcards (due to fire code).",
      "Kantwon is great. While the class is considered to be one of the harder intro CS courses, if you practice the material it will come to you eventually. Don't wait until the last minute to do homework, because you never know when there will be that one problem that takes you forever to do. Go to recitation. The TA's are probably the best TAs at Tech.",
      "I wasn't even in his section but I went to his lectures and have 0 regrets. He's truly the best professor I've had at tech (and I didn't take this class as a freshman). It's a hard class mostly because of the homework, but the homework is really well done so if you feel good about it you are pretty set for the exams.",
      "This guy is one of the best professors on campus. Take him, and if you can't go to his lectures anyway, you won't regret it.",
      "Kantwon is a great professor who is great at explaining confusing topics. This class was very tough (it just never clicked for me) and the homework takes a very long time, but Kantwon is definitely the professor to take this class with. You can tell he's very passionate about what he does and he makes topics understandable and adds in humor.",
      "Kantwon, the man of the hour, is exceptional at what he does. Teaches with style and charisma. One that teaches unlike any other. Lectures were enjoyable and incredibly helpful. Brace yourself,CS 1371 requires countless hours each weekend to complete coding sets.",
      "The goat of Georgia Tech, best CS 1371 lecturer ever. He is so creative and supportive of students and does an exceptional job at introducing and breaking down MATLAB concepts.",
      "Kantwon is a great lecturer, and so long as you do the homeworks and GO TO LECTURE. You'll be fine.",
      "He's a good teacher. This class is not nearly as difficult as people make it out to be. Just go to lecture, start the hws early, and do the hw by yourself so you understand it better.",
      "CS 1371 was my first experience with coding and Kantwon truly left a positive impression of programing. He is a funny lecturer and nows how effectively teach the course material. I'm so grateful for having him as my MATLAB lecturer and he is a true gem of Georgia Tech.",

      "Kanton is by far my favorite teacher ever. He is genuinely interested in students' success, explains topics very well and is an amazing human being. This is the most time intensive class I have taken at Tech but he has made it to be by far the most enjoyable.",
      "I hate computer science. I'm only taking it because it's required for engineers. Kantwon makes me want to add a CS minor. He is fun, lovable, and genuinely cares about his students. He wants everyone to learn how to Matlab and he teaches it so that everyone can understand, even when coding is completely foreign to them. Amazing professor and person",
      "Best teacher I've had in my life. Go to lecture because Kantwon makes difficult concepts seem straightforward. If you pay attention in lecture you won't even need to show up to recitation.",
      "Literally the best teacher at Tech. Don't even think twice. Take his class. It will change you. Go to every lecture. His class will change your perception of everything. Words don't do justice for how amazing he is. You will not only understand coding but learn to love MATLAB.",
      "Very difficult class but he knows what he is doing, very on-point and makes class fun. Hws are very hard but TAs are super accessible and tests are pretty predictable if you go to every lecture. HE IS AMAZING, EVEN IF YOU NEVER HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS, STILL MEET HIM ONCE IN YOUR LIFE.",
      "Great teacher, being in his class is a rare case of both informational and fun",
      "AMAZING MAN WOW",
      "The fact that he has 40+ reviews and a perfect 5.0 should let you know how he is. He is good. Actually amazing. Actually phenomenal. Actually there is no word that'll give him justice for how good he does his job. I don't think you'll have a professor like him after you take his class. He taught me something I never thought id be able to do.",
      "Kantwon is absolutely amazing and genuinely cares about teaching. He thinks of REALLY creative ways to teach all of his students and makes lecture really enjoyable. This was my first class 3/5 days of the school week and I would always be so pumped to go to this class as soon as I woke up! You'll be blessed if you get to have him for CS 1371.",
      "Definitely a gem in the entire GATech community. He understands how to communicate CS to millennials. He's so good that the giant lecture hall is packed EVERY class. He also offers scholarships to the students in his section which is HIGHLY EXCEPTIONAL and shows how much he cares about us. The content is hard but he made it so easy to understand!",
      "cool guy, class is pretty hard. Matlab is the worst. But Kantwon really loves teaching and he loves his students. He makes the sucky class a little less sucky.",
      "Kantwon is amazing. CS 1371 can be a difficult class, but his lectures are extremely helpful for understanding the material. He goes over very useful examples, and uses very helpful analogies to help you understand. Pay attention in class and do the HW in good faith and you will be fine. He really cares about all his students, so get to know him!",
      "Hands down, the best instructor for introductory CS at Georgia Tech. His lectures often feature Kahoot quizzes; he makes a lot of jokes; he has a solid background in education research, and is passionate about teaching. He is very easily reachable, and even has dinner with students in dining halls sometimes. 5/5!",
      "Kantwon Rogers may well be the best educator I have ever had. I've had good professors for sure, but I feel like the students who aren't allowed the chance to be in his lectures really are missing something. Relatable, funny, and genuine person. He wants you to learn CS, and he wants you to have fun doing it. Couldn't ask for a better professor.",
      "Coming from a person who is totally not a morning person, his lectures are totally worth waking up early for. There is a lot of homework for the class though as with any CS1371 class, and it takes FOREVER to do. There's also a huge curve a sorts at the end of the semester.",
      "Believe the hype. Kantwon is genuinely the best. His passion for teaching radiates from every lecture, which you should always attend. The homework in 1371 is obnoxious/time-consuming, but Kantwon does his absolute best to help make it reasonable. His lectures are some of the best I've ever seen: he's incredibly innovative in the ways he teaches.",
      "Deserves all the hype he gets. Cares about his students and MATLAB and tries to make the course as bearable as he can. Homeworks will still be time-consuming, though. If you show up to class, set aside a day of the weekend for the homeworks, and study the provided practice tests, you'll do well. If you don't get him, attend his lectures anyway.",
      "Kantwon's love for MATLAB shines in each of his lectures. He genuinely cares about not only what he teaches, but also all of the students. He made an effort to include everyone in a lecture attended by 150+ students, and was entertaining yet clear about what he was teaching.",
      "Couldn't have asked for a better professor for 1371. Kantwon just has a way with teaching CS that makes easy and bearable. He is EXTREMELY accessible outside of class and cares deeply for every one of his students. He is a really funny guy and always keeps lectures interesting. Not worth skipping his lectures!!",
      "100% recommend if you were able to get the class. Do not skip any of the lectures, because it is a GREAT way to start your day off. Kantwon is funny, smart, and the kind of teacher you want for this course. His test averages are the highest among all sections, and he will give you plenty of hints about the material on the midterms!",
      "Kantwon is an incredible teacher. As someone who had 0 experience with coding he made the material very understandable. He's hilarious and caring, and really seems to consider student feedback. Would definitely recommend.",
      "Amazing lecturer. Never had an interest in CS (hated it, in fact), but Kantwon made it much more accessible and easy to understand. Made me consider a CS minor (but the homework in this class made me not make that decision). Overall, the class is tough, but Kantwon makes it pretty easy with his amazing, hilarious, and clear lectures.",
      "Kantwon keeps the class entertained and uses fun strategies to teach the class. For example, he let me pie him in the face to demonstrate a concept. He is the reason why I have decided to pursue a CS minor. Try to take his lecture, but be prepared because his class fills up very quick.",
      "Kantwon is the reason why I actually like MATLAB"

      "Very well structured class and Bill is very funny and a very good lecturer. Weekly quizzes mean you're always up to date on the material. Homework is challenging but rarely frustrating except sometimes for some Assembly Language stuff. The material is hard but Bill does his best to make sure you get everything.",
      "I have taken 2 classes with Prof. Leahy (CS2110 and CS2316) and they were both my favorite classes at Georgia Tech. Leahy is the best professor I've ever had because his classes are really well structured. Weekly quizzes make it much easier to keep up with the material and not have your grade ruined by one bad day. Also, his lectures are great.",
      "Professor Leahy is a once in a lifetime experience at Georgia Tech! He is absolutely hilarious and a fantastic lecturer. There is a lot of homework and one exam which are a bit tricky but if you go to lecture and understand the material, they are very doable. Don't graduate Georgia Tech without taking a class from Professor Leahy.",
      "Funny guy. Has great lectures and even better Facebook posts.",
      "Definitely one of the most hilarious professors at Georgia Tech along with Greco and Simpkins. Lecture was always entertaining since Leahy likes to add humor to them and the topics are actually really cool imo. Quizzes, timed labs, and the final are definitely fair if you understand the material. The only downside is that some of the homeworks were",
      "What made the class was the TAs. Professor Leahy taught the lecture and the main concepts on how to code in C (specifically for the Gameboy). TAs went over what Leahy taught and ran the labs. There were no tests, relatively easy quizzes (every other week), weekly graded labs, and weekly homework. Attending class easy pass.",
      "I loved the way he expressed his knowledge and delivering way is so explanatory and provided the root knowledge. I had never seen that kind of interesting course.",
      "Leahy is easily the best teacher I have ever taken, I learned more in his class than all my others combined! Take him if you have a choice, but be ready to put lots of time into his classes.",
      "Really good explanations. Cares a lot about the students. Very open to additional help.",
      "I'm a grown ass man. I don't cry at all, and I haven't in years. Realizing I was done with Bill Leahy's class made me curl up into the fetal position and cry a river. 1010 one of if not the best teacher in the world.",
      "Amazing lectures. Shoots straight with you. Salty language. Be ready to code your butt off. Do NOT procrastinate on the coding assignments, especially the ones where you code a game.",
      "livens up computer science (which is hard to do). Grades are made up of quizzes (TA's review before) and homework",
      "He is the BEST of the CS department. He is really fun if you sit up front. Pay attention. He is friendly. Don't be afraid to ask questions. I could listen to him talk all day. 3 time-labs(easy) and just one final. Start homework early!!! Seriously! Get as many A's in the beginning. Last few weeks will kill you. Final was decent. Demos are easy.",
      "There is a lot to be covered in such a short amount of time, so it may seem overwhelming, but it all builds from the bottom up. While the material tends to be straightforward, this is definitely a class that will keep you on your toes. Mistakes are easy to make and, unfortunately, are punished severely. Leahy doesn't like partial credit. Good luck.",
      "Awesome professor! Super helpful and made the class enjoyable/entertaining. DON'T BUY THE BOOK. You never use it. I had never done any sort of programming before, and I made an A. Leahy made the material easy to understand and the homework assignments were pretty fun! Make sure you go to each lecture. Quizzes are pretty easy as well.",
      "If you've never seen this stuff before, he makes the class a little difficult. He assumes you already know C and won't actually teach it. Go to Office Hours and talk to him. He is really entertaining and funny, but is terrible at organizing lectures and doesn't know how to teach. The head TA taught everything on Piazza.",
      "I'm considering minoring in CS because I loved this class so much. Leahy is probably one of the most patient and good natured people I've ever met. He did a great job explaining things to nonmajors; I think I got frustrated with the other students more than he did. My CS friends say he's always like this too, though their classes are actually hard.",
      "Awesome teacher. Do all the homeworks to completion and review for the quizzes by looking at the old ones online on tsquare and you will get an A.",
      "He makes his lectures interesting with jokes and tries to make the class bearable, but it is still a fairly difficult class. The lecture and lab sometimes feel like different classes. The lab is taught exclusively by the TAs. Unless you are real smart, I wouldn't try going solo in this class. Make friends or go to the TAs for help.",
      "Super Awesome",
      "The professor is a great, funny guy. He really knows his stuff. But the real professor is Brandon, the head TA. He expects the best out of everyone, so makes all of the homeworks extremely hard, and often do not go along with lecture. Weekly hard homeworks, bi weekly hard quiz, bi weekly hard timed labs.",
      "probably the best professor i've ever had. this guy is awesome. the class was not a cake walk, but doing the assigned work and a bit more, an A is very attainable.",
      "Was a great professor, and covered the material that he chose to cover very effectively. Unfortunately, the hws assigned didn't correspond well to what was being taught in class. Also, this was a guinea pig class that was trying to incorporate parts of ECE 2030(physical memory design, etc.). Also had a companion professor who was no help at all.",
      "Bill is easily one of the best professors at Tech. His lectures are very entertaining and he does a great job teaching the material. The class can be rather difficult, but it's easy to get help from TA's and Bill.",
      "Bill is one of the best professors at Tech. I would learn more in just one lecture of his class than a week or more in other classes. He makes complex material simple with some awesome examples (barbie dream computer, anyone&#63;), and the final is not NEARLY as bad as I had heard from others. Prepares you very well for 2200 as well.",
      "Leahy is a great professor with very interesting lectures and fun assignments. I had him for 2110, which is a pretty challenging course, but I got the grade that I deserved.",
      "Best prof ever!",
      "Leahy is very helpful if you ask but he has no idea how to explain complicated material. His examples in lecture are very problem specific so rarely help much on homework or tests",
      "This man could teach CS to an idiot!!! Does a great job at covering the material and all around really great leacturer... really can relate and put things at a level his students can understand",
      "TAKE THIS TEACHER's CLASS, any that he offers. He is the most entertaining teacher I have had in 3 years of college. I learned alot from his lectures. Also, IGNORE previous guy's comment about tests. TA's also help make tests. I thought they were tough, but fair.",
      "THE MAN, I'd take any course he ever taught",

      "He cares about his students, and is accessible for extra help. He also has god level dad jokes. I believe he is one of the best professors at Georgia Tech for CS, as his class are fairly structured and lectures are fun to attend.",
      "Simpkins is one of the best teachers I've had here - easy tests if you study the PowerPoints. The homework can be slightly challenging sometimes but mostly very doable especially with a few friends. Highly recommend taking him - he makes the class very fun and even if you miss a week of lecture you'll be fine.",
      "Dr. Simpkins has very clear lectures with well laid out expectations.",
      "Simpkins is absolutely great! Lectures make sure you see things on a practical level. Homeworks took very little time compared to the harder CS courses. He teaches CS, not mindless coding! Only freshmen who've never taken a technical major course before complain. Don't listen to people complaining about technical language in a technical course.",
      "Homeworks are long and time consuming (esp the GUIs hw assignment). There was no final exam for this class (final project instead). Tests are manageable but be sure to review lecture slides and past homeworks. Lectures are unorganized (didn't learn much from them) so a lot of self-studying.",
      "He is a great lecturer and likes his topic. He takes feedback very well. His tests are very weird and not at all like other material from class. His questions are worded very weirdly and specific. The material isn't too hard though and the practice tests are sufficient",
      "I came in knowing a bit of Java, so his class was a bit easier to me than it might have been to others. However, he explains new concepts very well by building on ideas that we've been working on the whole semester. His tests are pretty easy, the homework is alright, and he'll drop small jokes throughout class just to keep it interesting.",
      "I loved 1331 with Simpkins. I knew Java going in, so it was pretty easy for me, but there was people who came only knowing MatLab or Python that struggled for the first month. Simpkins' lectures are actually very interesting and he makes all of his materials available to study with. Would highly highly highly recommend!",
      "Simpkins is an actual legend. 2316 was a chill and easy class that taught me a lot about data. The TAs are also great and I would highly recommend taking Simpkins for this class as he'll make it so much easier and fun.",
      "2316 is the easiest CS class I've taken. Homeworks aren't that difficult, and tests are beyond easy. He gives extra credit opportunities and 5 free points on exams. The final was all taken directly from previous exams. He had pop quizzes in class, but if you tried, he gave you at least an 80 on them. Really nice professor overall.",
      "He's a great man, take his class",
      "This class was a breath of fresh air this semester compared to my other classes. Show up to class when there are quizzes (sometimes unannounced). Do the homework well because it's worth 20% of the grade and there is extra credit. This class is a joke if you know python. Easier than 1301. Final exam is 30 mc about basic python. Take good notes.",
      "Simpkins is a great professor. He's very knowledgable about Java and I love that he tries to make learning fun. He splits the screen in lecture so one half are lecture slides and the other half is an example code. On top of being a good lecturer, he's also very dad-like and is a funny man.",
      "Would definitely recommend Simpkins. He's very knowledgeable about Java/OOP and keeps class interesting with relevant real world anecdotes to concepts we're working on. Would take him again if I could. As a warning, the class doesn't slow down, so don't blow off the first weeks to learn Java later.",
      "Amazing lectures",
      "I enjoyed the class. He was very knowledgeable about the subject and lectures were interesting",
      "Amazing professor, loves computer science. Pretty available outside of class, but when he's not there's always a TA available. Tests are filled with tricky questions so know the specifics.",
      "Great, engaging lectures, never boring. Homework and tests were fair and representative of the material we had to learn during the class.",
      "Dr. Simpkins is really enthusiastic, and I really liked his class. Even though there were some issues with homework (the first homework was unexpectedly difficult and took 3 months to be graded), Dr. Simpkins made things right (he cares about his students). The tests weren't all that difficult, and the homework had lots of extra credit available.",
      "He obviously knows what he's talking about, and if you worked in Java before the class is fairly simple. For those new to it, it might be harder since not everything is described in much detail as the tests are. Ample extra credit on the homeworks even though they take a while to get graded.",
      "Lectures are great, Dr. Simpkins has a great personality and is fun to listen to. Homework assignments may be difficult if you are not familiar with Java already, but all HWs and some tests have extra credit to catch you if you stumble.",
      "Simpkins was great for 1331! the homework assignments are reasonably difficult but the TAs are awesome and he's always willing to talk at his office hours. He makes a point to show he cares about his students' well-being, not just how they perform in class. It helps to have exposure to the coding language beforehand (Java).",
      "This man is incredible. He was getting his PhD and teaching this class all at the same time which really shows his passion for his subject. Lectures are never dull as he always entertains with music, dad jokes, or witty phrases. Overall, a phenomenal teacher and a great guy.",
      "Professor Simpkins is INCREDIBLY knowledgeable, and for this reason alone, anyone who has the chance to take his class should because he will teach you so much. He is inspirational, very wise, and highly motivating. The class is hard, but he offers extra credit and will curve tests when necessary (he often did). He is a truly caring guy; take him!",
      "Simpkins is the easiest grader for CS1331 and a great guy. Class can be hard to follow at first if you do not have much knowledge of Java, so going to TA office hours can help a lot. Homework assignments can be long and difficult, but they are the same for all 1331 classes. Would recommend him as a professor if you are going to take this class.",
      "Would recommend",
      "If Professor Simpkins is teaching a class you're wanting to take - register for his section right away. Easily one of the best CS professors and really cool guy too.",
      "Dr. Simpkins is great! He's really passionate and he offers the deep explanations that I crave to really understand the topics. In lecture, he doesn't just speak towards you, it's actually like a really big classroom where anybody can ask a question at any time. Very helpful if you ask for it. Easy if you already know some programming.",
      "Simpkins probably had the toughest semester of his personal life while teaching this class and never let that show. I learned more in his class that I can ever fully appreciate. The tests were tricky, but if you went slow it was pretty much impossible not to do well. The timed labs were the hardest part, compile-often!",
      "A cool professor. He gives some extra credits.",
      "He's a really cool guy",
      "Great professor. He's both enthusiastic and helpful in his lectures. Lectures are filled with relevant jokes and pop culture references to keep the material from becoming too dull. The homework is interesting but sometimes challenging (for the later homeworks, give yourself at least 2 days if you want to get everything done). Good professor10",
      "He is great! very helpful and nice",
      "He's an awesome teacher, with a great personality. His power points gave me life, however lecture can be really boring. The only thing I didn't like were the tests. It seemed like more of a manipulation of grades than an actual test sometimes. Enjoyed the class. Take him if you want to learn.",
      "Very knowledgeable and well prepared for every lecture. Always seems to be improving the course. If you pay attention to his lectures you will learn a lot. TAs are also generally very helpful."

Homework is good practice as well as old exam questions she gives you but don't expect the problems to be the exact same on the test. Just take good notes in lecture and you should be fine.",

      "Monica's lectures are really good and easy to understand. Most of the grading is based on tests, which are very doable if you understand the material. Homework is weekly but never takes too long.",
      "Sweat is a great professor. I'm was pretty irresponsible and bombed the first test due to not showing up to class, but got it together and began attending lecture much more often. She's incredibly pleasant, and very fair. If you make a reasonable effort you should definitely be able to get an A.",
      "She tells you exactly what is expected of you and as long as you follow the guidelines you'll get an A. The material itself is not complex -until the last unit-, you just have to format your answers *perfectly* to not get points taken off.",
      "Lectures were a little boring, but I found them helpful. Homework was harder than the tests. Overall not a very difficult class.",
      "Easy tests and helpful recitations, easy to get a good grade as long as you put forth effort. Weekly homework that can sometimes be a little long though.",
      "Great teacher, /very/ easy class so far. Have yet to take the last test, which is supposed to be harder than the others. Would recommend!!!",
      "Her tests are straight forward, she does her best to make the subject matter interesting, and make sure you go to workshops because that is where you learn the majority of the information.",
      "3 midterms, hw each week, and an optional final. You mostly learn how to solve simple math problems, manipulate pictures, and create basic web pages. As long as you attend lectures and recitation, the homeworks and exams are reasonable. Professor Sweat is a fair lecturer and her and the TAs do not hesitate to help you if you ask for help.",
      "Lectures are clear and informative, though occasionally a bit dry. Still, Prof. Sweat does have a personality and writes very fair tests. A decent amount of absences.",
      "1 homework per week. 3 tests throughout the semester (plus a final), and they're all pretty easy and not in depth. The TAs are incredibly helpful and active Piazza, so you can get help and your questions answered quickly. Professor lectures and clear and concise. Attending class helps because there are pop assignments now and then.",
      "Great professor. Fantastic at explaining difficult concepts, and she's not nitpicky on tests (she tests for overall understanding of concepts). If you go to class and do the homework, you'll be fine.",
      "Monica is my favorite professor in the College of Computing. She is extremely approachable and easy to talk to. Her classes are challenging but fair, and as long as you go to class and do the homework you should be able to pull out an A.",
      "An exciting and funny professor. Having never programmed before, I was able to understand everything clearly. There's homework every week and no curve for any tests. Test questions are very similar to examples done in class.",
      "Probably the best pick for CS 1331. The material/class is difficult, but she's helpful and accommodating if you go to class and do the work; definitely a good teacher to have on your side. She cares about you knowing the material and is open and approachable for questions.",
      "Best Teacher Ever!!! Learned a lot.",
      "She is an pretty good teacher as long as you pay attention in her class or read the textbook (since she pretty much follows along with it). She's easy to talk to if you have any questions or problems. Her tests are basically straight from the study guides she puts out, give or take the wording and a few numbers.",

      "she's AWESOME!",
      "Interested in teaching students the material so that they will be interested and actually learn it. She is always willing to help out with homework or other issues that arise. Puts out study guides before tests that are extremely helpful and is gracious in her grading - sometimes allowing for final exemptions if you have an A.",

The computer majors will drive you crazy with their arrogant questions but she tries to minimize this. Very easy tests.",
      "Eh, I thought this class was a breeze. But I had previous programming experience. Monica is really cool, and easy to talk to. Just go to class all the time, pay attention, do the homework, you'll get an A. I did. My test grades were 97,91,96, and my final was a 99. No problem.",

      "This has been my favorite professor at Tech so far. Not very easy to talk to, but if you pay attention in class and do the homeworks, you'll do fine. It was an easy A for me, and it was clear he knew what he was doing and loved the material. Final exemption is a possibility if you do really well prior to.",
      "Good guy, good lecturer, knows a lot about what he teaches. Your grade really depends on your grading TA.",
      "This class inspired me to switch my major to CS. I love Jay. He does an excellent job explaining the material as well as making it entertaining. The homework assignments and tests aren't too difficult, and help is abundant if you need it.",
      "He is really great, his lectures were really informative so you need to attend but he is really helpful. He is patient with questions, even if they've been asked three times already. The TA helpdesk is also a really great and helpful resource, and he is really helpful during office hours",
      "Summet is a generally nice guy and very helpful. Go to the TA helpdesk for all of the homeworks and your time spent will be cut 10 fold. Do NOT take the group learning class. He doesn't lecture in class and instead gives very tricky quizzes. The tests are very doable and some questions on the old tests reappear often. Would recommend.",
      "So he posts years worth of practice exams for all of the exams except for the final but the final is fairly simple. If you get team based learning, RIP. Get out because if you would rather have lecture, do well on exams and walk out with the A it'll make it a lot harder to do that but even in it, getting the A isn't difficult. Fair guy.",
      "Jay is the coolest professor I've had. I'd never taken CS before, but he explained everything really well, and he and the TAs were great about answering my questions. Read the texts he puts online, study your homeworks, and take lots of practice tests, and the real tests will be easy. The robots were also a lot of fun to work with.",
      "His tests initially frustrated me but really the only way to prepare is to just go HAM and do all the practice tests. They seem intentionally tricky, but honestly, I appreciate it now because I feel like I know Computer Science forward and backward. I had to work for my grade, but I feel like I am so much more appreciative of the material now.",
      "Summet is a great guy and an even better teacher. He's extremely friendly and has a great sense of humor. He really knows his stuff and he teaches it very well. The class isn't terribly easy but if you work hard you can get that A. If you have to take a CS class, I highly recommend this guy.",
      "Lectures were very straightforward and kept my interest. The tests were tricky, but all you had to do was get a B average to get an A in the course. His class website was very organized and made getting assignments and practice tests easy.",
      "Great professor. Helpful. Made lectures as easy and clear as possible.",
      "Professor Summet is extremely helpful, from the recorded lecture videos he posts on his website to the questions he answers about homework during class. His homework assignments are all doable, even if you've never coded before. Recitation is as useless as the TA's for this course, but you should go so you don't miss the pop quizzes.",
      "Top notch professor! No grade replacement though, but enough extra credit for you to never worry about the tests. That depends on your TA, though.",
      "He is a very good professor. I loved the class. The only problem I had with his class was that he kept his room really warm. I had him early in the morning and his voice is very soothing, so I would find myself falling asleep",
      "Professor Summet is a great teacher. Be sure to take notes on your computer on whatever he teaches in class, it will help a lot!! He is there to help whenever you don't understand, and he gives great final exam review webcasts.",
      "Jay is the best. Need say more? Always helpful and clear, tests are not too easy nor too hard. Too much homework? Well, CS is all about practice and excel. You'll find it rewarding.",
      "Fantastic professor. His explanations are crystal clear, so going to class is very helpful. Take him if you have the chance!",
      "Very interesting class and he explains concepts well. But when it came for tests, the material was surprising to me (I did the readings, coded in my spare time, had very high grades on the homework and quizzes). It was very specific knowledge about things that even a good programmer could forget for a second. Fun class though, and an A is doable.",
      "Very good teacher. He explains the material in class extremely well. Homework is sometimes difficult, but if you need extra help he is more than willing to take time for you. Tests are hard, but if you know the material he tells you to know, you will be fine. No tricks. Overall, I would recommend him",
      "Really cool guy, interested in CS completely due to his class, would recommend!",
      "I usually don't review professors but this guy is friggen awesome. I had no clue what cs was going into the class. Now I really really enjoy coding. Not a cs major but really sparked my interest in the class. TAKE CS WITH DR SUMMET!",
      "This is a rather easy class. There are free online chapters to read but I did good without reading them much. Its a very fun class, easy to get an A. Prof Summet is an amazing instructor, always very clear and goes slow so everyone can keep up and understand. Help is always available. I highly recommend this class.",
      "Good professor, has a vast knowledge of computer science. Material extremely dry.",
      "He is one of the best professors I've had. He has a lot of office hours and he helps students a lot. Very understanding and understandable. Except the demo part that few students like.In general highly recommendable",
      "Amazing professor. I had him for 1301 as well and he really sparked my love for CS. Quite a phenomenal guy who is always willing to help his students. His tests are tricky but whats a class without some fun?",
      "Very clear and fair. Overall, one of the best professors I've had",
      "Reaally great teacher especially if you sit in the front two rows! He teaches the class with scribbler robots (you will have to buy one or share with someone else if you choose). He uses a microphone to talk in class so he is audible. Very helpful during his office hours and even online!",
      "Quite boring for 2316, a huge class so it was hard to listen to him. We had clicker questions which forced us to go to lecture. Homeworks get really difficult and long, and his tests are quite tricky. Best way is to go over practice exams and listen to all details he goes over in class. If you do the practice exams though it shouldn't be too bad",
      "Jay is a fantastic lecturer. He will explain things very clearly, answer all questions, and demonstrate code thoroughly in Python. This class will teach you the basics of programming in the most effective way possible. If you're looking for a challenge, you may not want to take his class, but you'll still learn everything you need to.",
      "Good professor to learn Python from. Very helpful and will answer any question. The TAs make class fun as well. Homework and looking through old tests are great for studying the upcoming tests. Highly recommended.",
      "Great professor! You will learn A LOT during lecture. Recitation always has in-recitation assignments and you will learn very little in recitation. Some hw takes a while, but it is doable. If you are struggling with the hw, you can go to help desk and the TAs will help you understand and get through the hw. Exams are not bad. Study for them though.",
      "Took CS 1301, he is a good teacher, great at answering questions, there's a lotta homework/ several group projects to do, the tests can be tricky esepecially with the stupid robot. He is overall very good",
      "Excellent teacher. Definitely good to learn python from.",
      "Very willing to help students. Explains concepts as many times as necessary or until we get bored of hearing it. Nice, entertaining, good teacher.",
      "An interesting professor to say the least. He teaches exactly what is in the book, so there's no need to even read the book. He's a very nerdy professor and he and the TAs always give you the extra creativity points if you do something nerdy in the homework, such as incorporating Pokemon or memes. Overall it's very easy. The tests aren't so easy.",
      "This professor was extremely knowledgeable in what he taught. He was really great at conveying the information to the students and he made class fun and interesting. Many examples and videos were shown during class as a visual representation of what you learn. SO HELPFUL!",
      "Very helpful professor. I did not know anything about Computer Science but still managed to get an A in the class. He teaches using a lot of examples and posts lecture videos on class website. There are one or two pop quizzes throughout the semester during recitation, but they are very short and easy if you have been paying attention in lectures.",
      "Very clear and gives many examples. If you know anything about programming this class should be a breeze. Some of the assignments involving the robot are annoying.",
      "Jay Summet is the man. He's very organized and great at teaching. If you've never taken CS before, don't worry, because he takes it slow, explains it well, and will make things crystal clear for you. However, if you already have some CS knowledge, you'll want to skip this class for sure, he goes very slow. Or you can take the easy A and be bored.",
      "He is a very organized, fair professor. My TA wasn't the best, but overall the class was a great learning experience.",
      "No Comments",
      "I enjoyed this class. He taught intro to CS with robots. The robots can make it fun if you don't like CS, but can also offer a little challenge. He explains the topics well and makes some stuff interesting. Some of the robot assignments are fun. I didn't think the tests were that hard, but some people did. Overall, may be too easy for a CS major."

      "Great prof and great guy, plain and simple. If you truly pay attention, there's no test question that comes out of left field. Not a ton of extra credit but you can pick some up here and there. The final is kind of tough, but overall I would absolutely take him again.",
      "Stasko is definitely a good prof, but he does definitely expect you to know some things he only briefly talks about in class, which can be tough. Homeworks and exams are kinda tough, but definitely fair, and homeworks are good prep for the exams. Attendance is done with credit for 4 pop quizzes, but you should definitely go if you want to do well.",
      "Stasko is great. He's got a wonderful personality and a great understanding of Java. He's very nice, and his lectures do a great job helping students understand the concepts. As someone who had never coded in Java before, the class was tough. The logic is taught really well, but how comfortable you are with Java separates the As from the Bs.",
      "A great professor!! Stasko really cares, and he makes himself available to his students! I love how he handwrites the notes and has programs on the side to show us the concepts at work. The TAs for this class are also exceptional!!",
      "Dr. Stasko is a good professor, although the class is challenging. He writes his class notes on paper and uses a document camera in class, but you have to listen to him to understand the material.",
      "He is one of the best professors I've had at this school. Amazing lecturer, has strict grading guidelines, extremely fair. He is so good at explaining the material while not making it boring. His tests and homework are extremely fair. One of the best professors here.",
      "I withdrew the course at first and retook it with Stasko next semester and so happy with my decision. He is the best in explaining things. Sometimes he pulls out dad jokes as well. Would definitely recommend him.",
      "Best freshman CS prof at Tech. Homework can be strange. Lectures are incredible;.Stasko is a Java legend, we are his disciples. Everything he explained I understood the first time (except generics, but they're weird tbf). Tests are VERY fair and accurately test what is taught. If Stasko doesn't get 100 on his test, he gives back points. Good jokes",
      "Great teacher! Clear lectures, useful material (coding in Java). Doesn't post notes. I found the textbook very helpful (can find pdf and he posts optional problems from text). Homework is every week there isn't a test. Spent about 5 hours on each - start early! Wish I made it to more recitations but they aren't necessary. MUCH easier than CS1371.",
      "Clear material explanation, very helpful. He is easy-going as he mixes up his lectures with dad jokes. Tests are fair, but the class really picks up around Test 2, so make sure you do not fall behind. The recitations definitely help, but dont shy away from lectures either. Great professor.",
      "Just an awesome professor. If GT had more profs like him, we could easily surpass MIT on the ranking ladder.",
      "I really enjoyed Stasko's class! His lectures are clear and helpful, so much easier than learning it on your own. He doesn't post notes, so you do actually have to go to class. He's a reasonable guy, and very articulate. Your grade is based on 3 Tests, homework, participation, and final. Homeworks require approx. 5-6 hrs a week. Would recommend!",
      "Stasko is a really efficient lecturer and clearly communicates material in a way that is both engaging and entertaining. His exams are fair, and if you do the homeworks (which count for about 20% of the grade anyway) and study, the exams won't be an issue at all. Stasko posts practice problems from the texbook, but they are optional.",
      "Stasko is by far the best teacher for introducing Java. You will learn a lot about the subject in this class at a quick, yet understandable pace. The tests aren't hard, they are just tricky at some points. The homework is actually fun to do and the lectures are easy to follow. Great Professor.",
      "Stasko is incredibly good at breaking down computing concepts and keeping your attention. He is very enthusiastic in the way he teaches, and I personally had no trouble paying attention in every lecture because he made them so interesting. Totally worth coming 15 minutes early every day to grab a good seat.",
      "Stasko is a really solid lecturer. I'm not someone who focuses easily, but he held my attention. Definitely knows his stuff. The course isn't easy by any stretch, definitely practice inheritance/polymorphism, but if you study a fair amount you'll learn OOP basics pretty well. Textbook is easy to find the pdf for online.",
      "Professor Stasko is amazing at explaining concepts and his lectures are really clear, informational and interesting. Tests are fair but slightly tricky and weekly homework is straightforward.",
      "Stasko is very good at putting computer science concepts into understandable human language. Very clear at teaching and always hints at what will be on the test. His participation grade is from 4 ungraded pop quizzes so go to every lecture and you'll get an A. Textbook was helpful but unnecessary. Very straightforward class, very achievable A.",
      "Stasko was a true meme lord. His lectures were entertaining and you could really tell he cared about how his students were learning. He explained everything clearly and always made sure there were resources that students could look at if they had trouble. 10/10 professor!",
      "Consume whatever stimulant you need to do so, but if you don't stay 100% focused during lecture you will feel the pain. If you can stay 100% focused, his amazing lectures guarantee your A in the class.",
      "Tests can be challenging but very fair, covers exactly what he said he would. Attending lectures is essentially required because they are so good.",
      "Prof. Stasko knows how to engage the class and sometimes makes funny jokes. Only con I can think of is that it's sometimes very hard to see his handwriting especially in a terribly designed large lecture room and that HW isn't very challenging. He doesn't pull any tricks on tests, tests are very fair and matches the lecture contents very well.",
      "Literally best professor ever. Teaches so well and keeps students interested.",
      "One of the best CS professors I've had. He's really enthusiastic about his lectures, and going to class is an enjoyable experience.",
      "I loved Professor Stasko's class. The lectures were really informative, and he did his best to make them fun. I just went to the lectures and did the homework to get an A in the class. The book is not really necessary. It was helpful on occasion, but overall I didn't really use it that much.",
      "Stasko is a great professor. He is super enthusiastic, and actually cares about his students. 10/10 would recommend.",
      "Professor Stasko is a fantastic lecturer. He explains things so they are easy to understand, and provides lots of examples. He responds to questions very helpfully. His lectures are interesting because he has quite the sense of humor. The homeworks apply what is taught in class, and the tests are pretty straightforward. I would highly recommend",
      "He's a really clear lecturer. His tests aren't super easy, but they cover material that's expected and if you understand the homeworks you'll do fine. I used the textbook for the optional practice problems he sometimes assigned and it was really useful but by no means necessary.",
      "His lectures are great, and he has a very clear and concise teaching style. Being a lecture, class participation is too much to ask for, but that's not his fault. I would recommend him to anyone, and I hope I one day wind up in another one of his classes.",
      "Professor Stasko kept this class fun. He has a great teaching style, and though he requires you to know the material, he tests fairly and as expected.",
      "My favorite professor during my freshman year.",
      "He is a great teacher. I think the class could have been structured better, but it was still good. His ta's are awesome - very knowledgeable and extremely helpful.",
      "Very interesting class and he makes it even better. He really conveys the material in an understandable manner and he is very good at explaining potentailly confusing material.",
      "The class is pretty difficult (75% pass rate), but his lectures are interesting and really convey the material. The class is standardized, so you need someone who can explain the material well.",

      "She is good. She explains stuff well. She is very nice and willing to help you. The Material is easy to understand in lecture, but the homework and tests are challenging. You are not required to go to class but I would encourage you to. To succeed in this class, it is essential that you do all the homework, and go to help desk regularly.",

      "I had Marsicano for the first third of the semester before she had her baby. She's really a fantastic teacher and since she graduated from Tech she can really connect with what students are going through. She gives you exactly what you need to hear and doesn't make you do too much digging. She's very helpful and makes sure the students do well.",
      "I'm in a co-op right now, and I'm really glad I learned Matlab from Marsicano. The homework can seem confusing, but it's always applicable to real world issues. Stick with it.",
      "Looking back on it, I really enjoyed the class. Marsicano truly loves teaching matlab, and it shows. To do well, you really have to do all the homework (and be capable of teaching yourself). The murkiness of the grading system is annoying. Had I not made an A, I would have protested and LOUDLY about the secretiveness with which she keeps grades.",
      "her lectures are easy to absorb, definitely helpful.",
      "Marsicano is a really good professor. Her lectures are always fun and clear. If you do your homework correctly every week then you are golden for the tests. Don't be afraid to ask for help; the TA's at Help Desk are extremely helpful. Also, the book is practically never used.",
      "CS is a hard class, but Marsicano definitely makes the class interesting and do-able. I learned so much and she's so helpful. I rarely ever used the book unless I wanted to get a head start on the hw. Highly recommend taking the class with her! She's so enthusiastic about CS, it made me like the class a little more!",
      "A great prof for my 1st programming class! Very nice, not boring, and seems to enjoy teaching and the subject. Very approachable and helpful with questions. She also finds humor in programming.",
      "She was an AWESOME professor. I never missed a class and never had the need to use the book except for examples. She does plenty of interesting examples in class and it available outside of class as well. If you approach the class in a positive manner and do all of the homeworks and use all of the resources available to you you, it will be fine!",
      "The class on its own is hard, so there's no way around that. Marsicano is definitely better than Smith, as you actually learn during lecture. Recitation is extremely helpful, just make sure you have it early in the week. Otherwise, you're going to scramble to finish the homework by Friday.",
      "If you like programming the class is actually easy; busy but not too hard. Make sure you study A LOT for the tests no matter how well you have been doing; it's easy to make little careless mistakes in programming or forget proper syntax. It's a hard class for many, but the TAs and Marsicano work extremely hard to help everyone out. She's also cute.",
      "The class is hard, its GA TECH. She is really clear and there are alot of resources. If you work with the TAs, they will clearify concepts. Tests are timed on your own laptop with 5-10 TAs hanging over your shoulders. Do the Homework yourself and use resources for any question and you can get at least a B.",
      "It is a very difficult class for most people, but she is an excellent teacher.",
      "She is really pretty",
      "CS 1371 has a lot of material to go over, with usually over a 1,000 students. Consequently, it takes a lot of time outside class to understand, which is up to the student. Marsicano keeps lecture entertaining and does go over all the material, but unless you spend that time, you will be lost. TAs and Help Desk are awesome though for understanding.",
      "Great prof. I had a friend in Smith's lecture and she came to Marsicano's with me. She goes over code VERY similar to the hw and she tries her best to make sure everyone understands.",
      "I love her!! I missed a lot of classes during the semester but she posts the lectures online so if you need to go over it you have the ability to. She also makes class interesting; she likes to joke and she talks a lot but if you pay attention you'll understand it. Haven't finished the class yet but I have a 94% on hw and 89% on tests. Take her!!!",
      "Good class, but the homework takes forever.",
      "Going to lectures is fairly pointless, but the recitations teach you everything. Great class in which to play games or talk, though.",
      "This class was super easy for me. A lot of people complained about her, but she is just trying to keep everyone from falling asleep. If you want to do well in this class: GO TO THE HELPDESK!! They help you on your impossible homework. Also, i got an A in the class and had a 60% homework grade...",
      "Some people didn't think she did a good job; but if you actually go to class enough of the time, she covers pretty much everything you need for homework and tests. She keeps it fun too."

      "The key to succeeding in CS 2340 with Waters is doing a ton of extra credit -- I managed to get 120 percent on this class due to it. His lectures are not very useful and he is slightly lacking in classroom technology knowledge, but he is very willing to help and has a lot of industry experience.",
      "Not a bad class as long as you have yourself a good group to work with. The class is mostly made up of the group project. Tests/quizzes aren't too bad. Class attendance isn't mandatory, and I did not attend very often and did fine on the tests.",
      "Bob is amazing. If I could take him for the rest of my classes, I would.",
      "Bob is a really nice guy. Unfortunately it's the nature of 2340 that the lectures end up being pretty dry despite Bob's best efforts. A good grade doesn't require very much work.",

      "Waters is the nicest professor I've ever had. The class is super easy given you have a group that wants to do well. His lectures are funny, interesting, and he is just a real gem. Emailed him and he bumped my participation grade. He's the greatest!!!",
      "Amazingly Waters was an army aviation colonel before going into academia. Super chill for a guy who used to fly UH-60s.",
      "Class is very easy. There is a lot of extra credit opportunity and Professor Waters is very lenient. Lectures can be kind of boring and he does have pop quizzes which are just for attendance. (correctness doesn't matter). I recommend taking the class from him.",
      "One of the most enjoyable classes that I've had at Tech. Waters is very enthusiastic when he teaches, and he manages to teach object oriented design in a very fun way. Most of your grade is from a project, which isn't too difficult to develop, and most of the class is group work. LOADS of extra credit for extra implementation.",
      "The majority of the class is made up of group project that usually makes up over 60% of the total grade. There were three tests (including the final) that are over techniques used in good object oriented design. The professor teaches this material during lecture, and all the homework is made up of milestones towards the project.",
      "Don't bother getting the textbook for 2340everything it has can be easily googled. 2340 is entirely group projects. Be sure to do the extra credit, our team pulled an 1+13 letter grade from extra credit alone (and it was fairly easy too). Be sure to set up a consistent group meeting, though. You do need to know how to code.",
      "BAWB WATERS! Be ready to hear about helicopters and war stories whenever he's not teaching splay tree rotations. He's very concise in his explanations and a total sweetheart. He also wants you to succeed and offers a lot of extra credit on the form of projects",
      "I had this guy for 1332, 2340, 3300... and another class, I forget which. He is a great teacher in lecture and very helpful one-on-one. He gets a sort of bad wrap sometimes because his courses are not obtusely and unneccesarily difficult like most other courses and GT and because CS1332 baffles some people.",
      "He was clear about what we needed to accomplish for the semester and was a nice grader.",
      "High energetic and eccentric. Very clear. Understanding. Homework was a bit annoying, but can't complain because the exams and extra credit made up for that. He also plays WoW and Rift which is cool I guess.",
      "Got to work on a cool Anroid project. Lecture wasn't terribly helpful. Got an A.",
      "Overall he was very friendly and helpful if I needed to ask him a question. He gave tons of extra credit and a good amount of time to get the homework done. The tests were pretty easy if you go to class, pay attention, and do your own homework.However, sometimes he gets confused when teaching and erases everything before you know what has happened.",
      "Great professor. Homework does take some time but he typically gives a week or more to do it. He often replies on Piazza and is pretty helpful when you visit him during office hours. Attend lectures if you want to do well though mainly to get an understanding of what's covered. He also gives a ridiculous amount of extra credit.",
      "He's a good professor in general. I never have trouble understanding his lectures and he makes good use of visualizations on the computer. Homeworks are a bit tricky but he answers any questions posted on the forum and tries to give suggestions during class."

      "Gave lots of flexibility to allow teams to do what was best to get the project done. ZenHub requirement was sort of a bust, but I wished our team actually used it.",
      "This class was difficult, but one of the best I have taken at Tech. Projects were hard and can take up a lot of time, but they were graded very fair.",
      "Wish I had him for 1331",
      "Omojokun remembers students names which was cool to see in a large class. I didn't get an A due to the difficulty of learning to program without any prior experience. However, I'm thinking of switching to CS as a major after this class. Unfortunately it's not that easy to get in.",
      "Humor kept me awake during the long summer courses. Lectures were also example based which gave me a sense of accomplishment if I could do what he did.",
      "Makes lectures interesting with his examples and humor. He utilizes clicker questions, live coding examples, and the board to their full potential and thus explains concepts quite clearly. Homework is basically a small project every week, and extra credit is offered in the form of clicker questions.",
      "lectures use humor and clicker feedbacks for the most part. summer classes can be too long for programming classes though, you can catch up with the book if you miss class",
      "Great 1371 professor! Unlike most people's experiences, I learned almost everything in lecture rather than recitation. If you do the homework and go to Omojokun's lectures, the class is easy, and I had no coding experience when I started.",
      "Best of the 1371 professors. You don't need to know code before hand. He explains everything in terms that are easy to understand (no necessary jargon). Of course most of the important things are covered in recitation but I found Omojokun's lectures as good review.",
      "Solid professor. I came into the class with no coding experience and nearly pulled an A, and it was solely thanks to Omojokun's lectures. He gives clear, concise lectures that provide a good basis for the homework problems and provides plenty of PRS questions for practice. He's also really entertaining. The best option for 1371 in my opinion",
      "Good professor if you have never done any programming before. 99% of material on the tests and homework will be taught in recitation though so I mostly used lecture to do homework. Tests aren't even made by the professors, just as an fyi.",
      "decent professor. knows what hes doing. 1371 seems like its gonna kill you, but its not so bad. paying attention helps. tests are always hard, but theres a huge curve + grade replacement on the final. hws take alot of time, but he explains what you need to do pretty well.",
      "Very helpful professor, you can ask your questions during class and if you still don't get it, he'd offer to take your problems after class. And, he has a deep, interesting voice!",
      "Omojokun's a great professor. Really laid back class. 1331 is straightforward and about 60% of it is AP Computer Science Material/Level of difficulty- however, it is not an easy class to get an A in. Practice Java , understand the concepts and do the homework. Getting a B is very easy, but OO will make you work for that A.",
      "Really laid back, very open to discussions and questions in class (yes, even in a huge lecture hall). Explains stuff very well, and is very easy to listen to (not dry at all). Tests, hw, etc is all given by the department.",
      "His class is incredibly laid back, making it easy to ask questions. In fact, he seems to \"wing\" his lectures, and teaches in a \"so yeah,whatever\" style. Nevertheless, he is a good teacher. The assignments, quizzes, and tests are fair.",
      "Makes himself very approachable, which is good cause I didn't always understand what was covered in lecture."

      "Dr Joyner clearly loves to teach and is very good at it. You'll work hard in his class, but he's very available and helpful, and you'll learn a lot.",
      "Dr. Joyner is the best teacher I've had at Georgia Tech and I took the CS 1301 online class with him. His video lectures were clear and concise. I had never taken any CS course before this one. I only had to complete 3 problems on the final for a 95 overall in the class. Definitely recommend him.",
      "This is perhaps the best class I've taken. You can go at your own pace, and you cannot receive less than a one hundred on any homework assignment unless you give up. You get multiple attempts on test questions, and you can submit coding problems as many times as you want before you get it right. This class is very easy and works to any schedule.",
      "The best class I've taken at Georgia Tech. I am a business major, and it made me think about switching to CS. The online format is amazing and so much better than in person. You get to run/test/debug your code as many times as you want before you submit it on a test (other CS sections are paper only). You can complete material at your own pace.",
      "This guy is awesome! He made the class really accessible and makes it interactive and engaging even though its online. You will actually learn from examples and videos if you pace yourself and don't wait till last minute. Since you get 1 or 2 attempts for each mc and unlimited submissions for coding problems there isnt partial credit",
      "Professor Joyner is the best CS professor I've ever had a class with by far. I took the online section, which is definitely worth it. Pretty simple A if you do your work and his recorded lectures are really good. Definitely worth taking a class with him.",
      "Take CS 1301 online!! This course is a really effective way to learn it. Joyner's video lectures are really concise &amp; the lessons are broken up by exercise questions so you don't get distracted/bored; vids are 3 mins long on avg. Really manageable class; its schedule is properly paced and very flexible, but don't procrastinate or you'll struggle.",
      "Videos for learning are very good. Schedule is a bit flexible since it's online, but don;t get too far behind because it's a decent amount of work. Test are legit even though online- they very much monitor you, but if you do the learning an homework and put just a little forethought into the test you should do well. Responds quick to questions.",
      "The online section of CS1301 is great,do not be apprehensive because this class is online. The majority of the grade comes from lessons and problem sets that have unlimited attempts, and the tests are simple . Requires a little bit of effort, is an easy A, and you'll learn as much as the inclass section without having to take trips to the help desk",
      "I never really write reviews on here, however I had to with this professor. He is hands down the most caring professor I have ever had. He wants every one of his students to succeed and will go above and beyond to make that happen! Take him!!! You will not regret it.",
      "Even though I didn't leave with an A in the class, this is without a doubt the best course I will probably take at Tech. You need self-discipline to do the work though because he usually gives you until the day before the test to turn in the work. It'll start off a bit slow, but don't let that fool you. Just do the work in a timely manner to pass.",
      "Best class I've ever taken, online or not. His Piazza responses are very detailed and helpful. If he's not available, Piazza falls apart, even though we had many students answering questions, too. Bc it's a large class, there are a lot of questions. If you can't reach him by Piazza, he is very good about Slack responses. Tests taken online",
      "First time taking online class and it was great. You watch short videos and you do exercises throughout. Take good notes and do the problem sets and you should be golden for the test. I never had to go to office hours. Plus, some of the tests he would give you the questions beforehand. If you have to take CS1301, DO IT ONLINE. You won't regret it.",
      "I've taken online classes before and had terrible experiences, but both the layout of the course and the professor itself are excellent. It takes self-discipline like any online class, but the professor is very qualified, passionate, and answers emails, slack, and Piazza questions promptly.",
      "David is one of the best professors I have ever had. He's extremely involved with his students, going above and beyond to get in touch with them. The class I took him for (CS 6400) was extremely freeform and he did a fantastic job allowing students to pursue something that interested them while still accomplishing all of the learning goals."

Do the homeworks, use the CS1371 website for data banks and review videos, and find a recitation with a good TA to go to to help learn the material even more. Just don't slack off and you'll have a good time.",
      "Stallworth really knows his stuff and is a solid prof for 1371. Kantwon is a little better but Stallworth is way better than having Smith. That said, the class is just difficult in general, but he makes lectures funny and entertaining. Go to class it makes it way easier.",
      "Stallworth is a fantastic lecturer. Although I prefer Kantwon's lecture code, I find his lectures to be just as educational. He explains things well and teaches what you need to know for the homework and tests. On top of being good at teaching MatLab, Stallworth is a really entertaining and funny. I enjoy being in his class.",
      "He's a very good teacher -- makes sure to give lots of examples and demonstrations. Very personable as well, constantly tells funny stories when he has extra time in the lecture. My one complaint is that he doesn't communicate well with the TA's so he is often teaching material for homeworks that were already due.",
      "To do good in CS 1371, all you need to do is go to recitation and do your homework, nothing more. BUT Stallworth is a great teacher, and will make the class alot easier. His greatest trait is that he is very entertaining, while still very good at explaining concepts. You will not find a better CS professor than him.",
      "Awesome lecturer. The best you'll have for CS 1371. He's entertaining and explains concepts very well. Go to class, do the homework, and the review sessions you'll be fine. This is a very time-consuming class, so plan your schedule accordingly.",
      "Awesome and funny professor. I only attended his lectures to be entertained. MATLAB is tough at first but gets easier once you know the basics. Actually do the HW because you need to know how to code on the tests. Review sessions by the TAs are very helpful. Do well on the final and he replaces your poor test grades. Got an A in this class.",
      "Great teacher, makes cs tolerable. He knows how to explain concepts and show appropriate examples well. One of the best lectures, especially for a cs class.",
      "Awesome professor, he's a pretty good professor and he makes class very entertaining. Definitely try to get him if/when you take CS 1371 (and if you're an engineering major, you will). The class can be kinda tough if you don't pay attention and work at it though, just a warning.",
      "The best CS1371 teacher. A must have. He is funny and both well paced and versed in the material. The tests are hard as hell but the staff will do their best to help you out. The class and homework overall are very time consuming. Be warned.",
      "He is the best out of all the CS teachers. Lectures are by far the least boring. The class itself is hard as hell, but this former NFL player tries his best to make class enjoyable. Besides, all the teachers use the same tests and final anyway, so you might as well pick the most interesting professor.",
      "A good teacher and a really funny guy. take him in if you want to have fun. test are prepared by TA's, but go to reviews and u should be good.",
      "He is the best professor who teaches 1371. The class itself is hard as hell, but that has nothing to do with Stallworth, since he is not the one who makes up the homeworks and tests. There are a lot of chances to make up points (labs, mini-quiz) in the class though. If nothing else, got to class and Cedric will always make u laugh. He is a blast.",
      "Amazing Professor that keeps you intrested in a pain in the butt course. Extremely nice and lots of fun! And take this advice from someone who has taken and failed the course once... YOU WANT STALLWORTH OVER ANYONE ELSE!!!"

      "Downing was a great professor who really cares about his students learning the material well. Although I was nervous about the HackerRank exams and the cold calling, I feel like it really helped me improve my knowledge of how to be a good software engineering. His class was challenging, but I feel like I was able to get a lot out of it.",
      "Downing is a good professor who really knows the material he teaches. I did not love the cold calling or the disconnect between the projects and lectures, and I would also not recommend taking this class if you haven't done Java in a while. The course is overall very rewarding and the exams are not that bad.",
      "I think Downing's class is one of the more organized and interesting UT CS classes out there. His grading criteria is pretty clear, and the tests are doable, especially if you make sure to do his hackerrank exercises before them. He does do randomized cold calling, so maybe skip this class if you have anxiety about that.",
      "Great professor, well taught and very accessible for questions. If you put in the work you will do just fine and learn a whole lot. Cold calling can be intimidating but Downing walks you through whatever is happening well until you understand. Side note: taking alongside with OS is not recommended, I did it and survived but would not recommend.",
      "He's a good guy who does his best to design a course that will teach you or force you to learn about industry-relevant skills. He might come off as a little rude, but the fact that he gives extra credit, offers make-up exams, and delays deadlines if he feels it's appropriate shows that he cares about his students. Group projects are a lot of work.",
      "Overall I think SWE is a good class to take with Prof. Downing. The tests aren't too bad and you definitely are engaged throughout his lectures. The projects for this class are pretty intensive and it's crucial that you get a group that consists of members that all actively contribute.",
      "This was definitely the class I've learned the most in during my time at UT and the amount of work reflects that. There's a large disconnect between lecture and homework, so much of it is learning on your own and it gets difficult to juggle at times but would definitely still recommend. Many of these skills are very applicable to post-grad jobs.",
      "You learn a lot in his class but it is not a majority A elective. Except a B to be a possibility when joining his class.",
      "Prof Downing is a great lecturer and keeps you engaged by &quot;cold calling&quot;, so be prepared to answer his questions! The majority of the grade in this class is based on a group project, and I would say that grading is a little arbitrary, or requirements aren't specific enough at times. Furthermore, the tests are very hard to get partial credit on.",
      "He is a good professor and this is a great class. However, the project and lecture do not have a strong relation. So be prepared for the self-learning for different web development tools.",
      "Downing really knows his material and wants you to learn too! The class is pretty accessible, so if you have a question someone will answer it. I felt that projects, despite the claim that it was about a good website, just became fulfilling requirements. Tests were difficult and stressful.",
      "Overall makes class pretty interesting and requires you to pay attention because he cold calls. Laptops are not allowed and there are somewhat easy quizzes at the start of every class (though you get some drops). Projects are in groups of 5-6 and are pretty work intensive.",
      "Downing is really clear at what he taught. The project isn't hard, they require patience",
      "Downing is a great professor. Anyone who wants to go into industry should take this class. The projects expose you to many different software tools. The project specs were very unclear until the very end, making it difficult to get the projects done early. He cold-calls but helps you get to the answer. Main advice: GO TO CLASS!",
      "Just show up to class enough times to get those quizzes done. You should still not skip at all. Get started on the projects early. If you do that and do decent on the test, you'll be fine. You'll learn a lot of juicy Python.",
      "I'm not a fan of cold-calling at all. There is also occasionally conflicting information regarding project requirements, making the projects more difficult and stress-inducing than necessary. Useful course if you're planning on going into software dev.",
      "Great class! You work on a huge web app group project the whole semester, so make sure you get a good group with both frontend and backend experience. Downing is a really respected professor, I highly recommend taking him before you graduate! The lectures aren't bad and go by quickly. Lot's of work, but pretty fun and worth it!",
      "A really good class to get creative and devote time into. The requirements for group projects can be ambiguous but the projects are still graded fairly.",
      "The course involves a large, group-oriented project that is the majority of your grade. It will largely be worked on out of class and requires a lot of man-hours. However, the knowledge you build from this project and the structure of the class is useful as a computer science major as it is intentionally reminiscent of the industry environment.",
      "Downing is a well-respected lecturer at UT for good reason. He cares about the quality of his classes and forces you to sink or swim. SWE is a huge workload, but you end up learning a lot of skills in order to be successful. I would highly recommend organizing a group before taking the class, as the projects aren't manageable without a solid team.",
      "Huge disconnect between what is taught in class and what is expected to be done in the projects. However, the TA's help a lot. Tests are on HackerRank, so that can be stressful.",
      "My freshman year, I was told to take all the Downing classes that I could by multiple UTCS graduates that are now working in the tech industry. Now I understand why. OOP and SWE are challenging and fast paced, be sure to prepare for Hackerrank exams, but I feel as though it has prepared me for my first developer job after graduation.",
      "A good CS upper division. Definitely practice the HackerRanks before tests.",
      "There are daily attendance quizzes so definitely go to class. If you don't the exams will probably be rough. Overall the class is a pretty decent amount of work but also has a pretty decent amount of helpful information for anyone trying to become a pretty decent CS major. 8/10 Pretty decent.",
      "Glenn's a really good lecturer, but material covered in class doesn't relate to projects. He really tests your chops in Python, and not knowing Python is what made the difference between a B and an A for me. Projects were cool and I feel like I was forced to learn a lot on my own. I'm a slacker, but still would highly recommend.",
      "Hard class, lecture material doesn't line up with projects but is expected to be known for tests. However this is a very rewarding class and you will enjoy suffering.",
      "One of the few professors at UT that I can say changed my way of thinking and actually prepared me for the real world. His lectures are always engaging and he writes notes down for you so you can just pay attention to the material while you are in class and review the notes later. I didn't read the textbook much but for certain topics, it helps.",
      "Semester project can be really heavy if your group is not equally contributing.",
      "Downing is a very enthusiastic teacher. Attendance is mandatory, but several daily quizzes get dropped. I think the tests are hard, and the projects are time consuming. Overall, a great class.",
      "SWE is a fun class and lets you learn a lot about some different technologies out there. Downing is a good professor and I do not have any major complaints. He has daily quizzes but many of them are attendance and there are t a lot of drops. Overall I would say he is a top 5 professor I've had at UTCS.",
      "This is the most project intense class I have ever taken, but at the same time, this is the most rewarding class experience, in terms of giving you the knowledge of how real life project will be made. The lecture is disconnected from the projects, but professor Downing gave a great lecture with HackerRank exercise to do in class.",
      "Downing is a really great professor that really cares about how you do in the class and that you actually learn. The projects and their requirements can be a pain sometimes, but overall they teach you a lot about SWE work. The tests aren't difficult provided you go to class and actively participate in the hackerranks.",
      "Has to be one of the best lecturers I had. He cold calls you in class but he would make you feel like you could answer anything. His lectures are great. He explained every detail of the concept to make sure you understand. Don't recommend if you're already a web-dev pro.",
      "Really liked his enthusiasm and knowledge on c++ but I really disliked how one of your projects was assigned over Thanksgiving break, and we had to pair program for 75% of it. Besides that I really enjoyed the class and he is quite the humorous guy.",
      "He does a good job incorporating class participation via random cold calls. The lectures are great w/ notes provided at the end of each. Therefore, you may doze off if you rely only on the notes. When it comes to talking w/ him, he is kind and willing to give you some advice on the projects.",
      "Professor Downing has been one of my favorite professors so far. He is so passionate about everything he is teaching. He does cold calling to ensure participation in the class and because of that, I was engaged the entire hour! Definitely a good one!",
      "Professor Downing really cares about teaching his students. His is flexible and accommodating, but still will challenge you. This class gives out what you put in. Depending on how into it you are, you will learn a lot.",
      "Was a fun class with a lot of work. Prof. Downing knows his stuff and teaches it in a fairly engaging way.",
      "Great professor, really fun to talk to and super available and willing to help you succeed.",
      "Downing is an amazing lecturer, and SWE was just as much fun as OOP. I highly recommend that everyone take at least one of his classes.",
      "Make sure you find yourself a good group. The projects are too big to do them alone.",
      "Attendance is mandatory. There are reading materials, but honestly it's absolutely managable not to read a single assigned material and still get an A.",
      "The lectures are very in depth. Attendance quizzes are assigned every day so be sure to attend classes.",
      "Software Engineering was intense. It is very project heavy. Classes are mandatory. The quizzes were harder than in OOP. I thought this course was ok. Although I learned a lot, I would have preferred to have learned the material in class rather than on the fly for each project. The lectures were interesting, but sometimes not helpful for projects.",
      "Prof. Downing also teaches SWE; expect SWE things to filter in. Not a &quot;fun&quot; class IMO-- I wouldn't take unless it's a prereq, or you hate fun. Participation is important in this class; you can be dropped a letter grade for missing enough quizzes. Late policy for projects is gracious. Largely a C++ class (haha) at first but eventually becomes OOP.",
      "The class is fun and engaging, and downing is a very animated professor. There's daily pop quizzes but he drops the lowest few.",
      "Great professor and lecturer. There's pop quizzes every day and they can be kinda difficult. The quizzes are also all out of 5 points so if you miss 1 point then it's an automatic 80 for that quiz. They aren't worth a whole lot individually, but they add up over time.",
      "The professor gives a really amazing lecture that constantly keeps you engaged and makes you want to learn. There are group projects, web development done in various phases, that doesn't relate to the content of the lectures. The tests are straightforward if you understood the lectures.",
      "SWE is very similar to OOP: cold-calling, daily quizzes, an easy solo project, group projects. In SWE, you'll build a website with a group of 4 other people. It's fairly easy to get enough points for a B, but getting more than that requires much more effort. The lectures / tests / quizzes aren't related to the projects, so you still need to study.",
      "Focus on practical hands-on experience rather than theoretical design. The group project is a great opportunity to try out working as an engineer.",
      "Really loved this class! Clear he knows what he's talking about. He cold-calls during class, but didn't mind that really. Also very good at telling you your answer is wrong without making you feel stupid, then explains the correct answer to you and does a good job of making you feel involved in the process. One of my favorite classes this semester!",
      "Downing's class is well organized and structured, and his lectures are interesting and explain concepts fairly well. If you have anxiety like me, his Socratic method and blog posts, as well as the constant group work probably won't sit will with you. Otherwise I think his class is a good choice, and a great way to get introduced to OOP and C++.",
      "Downing's OOP is a well designed and executed class. He will not lecture in the traditional sense. He teaches in a Socratic seminar style where everyone participates. The quizzes at the beginning of the class are the only draw about the class. But they really are a necessary evil.",
      "Downing is an amazing lecturer. You learn a lot about the little details of everything, and he really makes sure you understand the reasoning behind certain features of object-oriented programming languages. Quizzes can be pretty tricky, but even those are designed to test very specific knowledge that is relevant to the things he talks about.",
      "Solid class with great lectures and a clear grading criteria. A lot of relevant material is covered that will help you in your CS career. To get an A just put in the effort and go through the motions and you should be fine (as long as you don't bomb too many quizzes).",
      "There are quizzes every day and he cold calls for attendance points, but it's a useful and interesting CS class to take. The projects aren't too bad.",
      "Great lecturer, very clear about the concepts he presents and is open to questions during class. However, as soon as he covers a concept he doesn't hit it again, so missing class might hurt. Past that, he's happy to talk to students during office hours and definitely helps. One quiz per class and grading is very clear but strict.",
      "lectures go in depth for a low-level understanding of c++ class is pretty straightforward - 5 projects with option of working with a partner for extra credit attendance quizzes can be pretty ruff exams are fair and on hackerrank very organized and structured class overall",
      "Downing is an amazing lecturer and he is always prepared for lecture each day. There are daily quizzes, which might be frustrating for some people, but for me, these quizzes helped ensure that I actually remembered key material from the previous day's lectures. The projects were pretty easy as far as computer science goes but still very helpful.",
      "I really enjoyed his class. Although it is really project heavy",
      "He's an amazing professor. I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot, especially a deep understanding of Python. It's not very hard, although you have to be constant since there are daily quizzes. The project is fun to do and you are pretty much free to use whatever you want to use. Make sure to pick a great team.",
      "A great professor. He makes clear points and strictly follows his own schedule, so you would not get lost in his lectures. The funny thing is that the lectures are not greatly related to your projects, you need to do your own research on various tools and platforms.",
      "Good Professors, most of the projects are interesting and not too challenging",
      "Dr. Downing's lectures are fantastic. They're clear and comprehensive. You'll learn a lot without getting lost in the details. He's definitely one of my favorite lecturers at UT",
      "An amazing lecturer and caring professor. He is clear, precise, and thorough. The course is more like two courses: in-class and projects are disparate. Quizzes are terrifying: every class day - on canvas. Exams can be tough but fair: on hackerrank. A is doable. Great class and you'll learn a ton especially if you know nothing about web development",
      "You will learn a lot.",
      "Prof. Downing constantly engages with the class to explain examples. The large group projects can be a pain, but they get easier around halfway through, and its a worthwhile learning experience.",
      "Really good professor. Teaches with the socratic method. I disliked the first project because it had to be done alone. I wish he would go over how to set up some of the required software (EG: Docker). Quizzes are horrible. Covers mainly python, but tests on JavaScript as well. Overall, a great lecturer. I just wish I could have taken in the fall.",
      "Great class. The most valuable thing you'll get out of this course is your group project (and it's a large part of your grade), so make sure you have a good group that's willing to meet a lot and works hard. Quizzes get tough and will grind down your grade. Meeting project deadlines is hard, especially in Phase II, so beware!",
      "Prof. Downing is a great teacher. I have learned a lot from his summer software engineering course. Tests were online through Hackerrank. There were Canvas quizzes every class, and lectures were very important to attend in order to get the most out of the course. There were one solo project and 4 group projects. Overall he is an excellent teacher.",
      "Best CS Professor I've had so far at UT. Super passionate about teaching, and you'll learn a lot about Python and Javascript from his lectures. Group project may seem daunting at first, but if you have a good group of motivated people(prior experience is a plus) then you'll do fine, and you'll also learn a lot about web dev..",
      "A project-based, somewhat work-heavy class. Lectures are very effective, a bit tiring. Overall a very good class.",
      "Professor Downing is one of the best professors I've had at the University. His lectures are engaging and his &quot;cold calling&quot; strategy ensures that we pay attention and know what's happening. The projects in this class also taught me a lot of necessary tools that are essential for working in tech.",
      "Professor Downing's lectures are very engaging, and the materials are well organized. Tests are fair, you can do well if you pay attention to lectures. However, beware that most of the projects in this class are group setting, and the difficulty is high if you don't have prior web development experience. So, group communication is very important.",
      "Professor Downing teaches in a way that makes it very easy to learn. He definitely prepares you for industry.",
      "Professor Downing gives entertaining and informative lectures on detailed aspects of many programming languages. The exams and quizzes are challenging but doable. I learned a lot about different languages and tools that are practical in industry.",
      "I have never learned more from a professor than from Downing. He makes you truly understand what is happening and prepares you for real world jobs.",
      "Downing's class is great. Just remember, every point counts towards your grade, and it's important to do well on quizzes, projects, and the first exam. You'll need it to buffer your last exam grade.",
      "Professor Downing is a fantastic lecturer, He does a really good job of keeping students engaged, and actually calls on students in class. The course is very group project heavy as far as time and work goes. All of the stuff in lecture will be on the exams but the majority will be spent working on the internet database project. It uses react warned",
      "OOP is formatted almost identically to SWE, but don't believe that they're the same class--OOP is much easier. After taking OOP I went from being anxious about C++ to writing it comfortably. Lectures are incredibly clear and engaging, projects are manageable (unlike SWE). The final exam is no joke, but doable if you've been doing well in the class.",
      "Downing is a great professor. He keeps the lectures engaging and interesting. You have to learn all the tools for the projects by yourself (a good experience to have). I've learned a lot out of the projects, plus I have one more thing to put on my resume. The exams are all coding and they are over the material covered in class (not projects).",
      "Truly an awesome professor. He cares about his students and the subject he's teaching. The class is basically teaching you everything you need to know about C++, one of the best classes I've taken. I've started doing interviews in C++ because he goes so in depth with C++ that it is now my favorite language.",
      "Downing has a very engaging, active lecturing style and is very knowledgeable about the C++ content covered in the course, making OOP, as a class, very enjoyable. As long as you go to class, actively review the notes that he posts on his website, and practice the in class exercises before the exams, you'll probably have a good experience.",
      "Great professor that cares about his students.",
      "Downing is a very good professor. His lectures were engaging and useful. I feel like I learned a lot of useful knowledge about C++ in this class. Not a difficult class as long as you attend lecture and do the projects.",
      "Absolutely wonderful professor. I love how he uses the Socratic method to teach and engages every single student in class. I learned a TON in this class and am ready for a Software Engineering career now!",
      "You will learn a lot in Professor Downing's class, but you will have to put in the work. For Software Engineering, there is a slight disconnect between the lectures and the tasks required to complete the projects, but there is plenty of help available. Lectures involve language-specific details and the project is to build a dynamic website.",
      "Professor Downing really cares that everyone is up to speed on the material. We have quizzes every day and he calls out people in class in order to answer questions. However, he never makes anyone feel stupid or anything. I enjoyed this class since Professor Downing goes really in depth with the material and keeps it interesting.",
      "The work really pushes you to learn new tools but the return on investment is huge. Downing is a great guy, he cares a lot about his students.",
      "Everything assigned in this class is for a reason. I really feel like I learned useful material to be applied after graduation.",
      "It's a modern C++ class. Dr. Downing is very knowledgeable in the subject matter and does a good of explaining the intricacies of the language. It's a worthwhile class if you are interested in how the choice of programming language affects the decisions we make in the object oriented design process.",
      "Professor Downing really makes his class very interactive and interesting. I think that his class is amazing but if you're not interested in learning C++, that's all this class is. Attendance quizzes at the beginning of each lecture to test your knowledge of the material - they weigh heavily on your grade. All of the exams are on Hackerrank.",
      "Lectures are really solid and past the intro week you really do learn a lot about C++. Classes are mandatory through attendance quizzes. He randomly calls on a people each lecture but I respect that he manages to enforce class participation without making anyone feel nervous or bad regardless of their answer. Projects and tests are standard.",
      "Super engaging, and the projects you work on really give you a sense of working as a team. Be prepared to dedicate long hours working on your site though.",
      "The main project for this class takes a ton of time. However it teaches you a ton of tools that people actually use and will be very helpful when applying to jobs. Don't take this class with other project heavy courses especially ones with group projects or you will struggle.",
      "Class was a lot of work. Be prepared to meet up with your group often and come to class to take the daily quizzes. The quizzes are tricky and the tests are all on hackerrank so you need to be very comfortable with hackerrank and all of the concepts on the review/all of the class hackerrank assignments in class. Be prepared to be cold called.",
      "Great lecturer. This class will prepare you extremely well for interviews and give you a strong understanding of at least one part of web development.",
      "Downing is a great lecturer, who can make normally mundane things actually pretty interesting. The course material is useful, though not the most enlightening being mostly a course on C++, but he makes it nonetheless worthwhile. For anyone looking to improve knowledge of OOP and learn C++, this class is highly recommended.",
      "Took his CS373 SWE class, but that wasn't an option listed for whatever reason. He's a very solid professor, but there are daily 5 minute quizzes that can be challenging. It's really important to pay attention in the entire class. Otherwise you'll likely miss something that will be on a quiz or built on during lecture.",
      "I found this class to be extremely satisfying, and I learned a lot. I loved the lectures, and the projects provided enough challenge to teach concepts without being impossible. Take this class if you want to become a better software developer. Take this class or CS373 (with Downing) before you graduate if you want to have an easy time finding a job",
      "Prof. Downing is great! Projects are intensive but useful. Lectures don't help too much with the projects, but he's up front about this from the beginning and they are key to passing the exams.",
      "Downing is a great professor. Every CS student should take at least one of his classes. I just took OOP, and I plan to take SWE next year. He randomly calls on people during class. Do not fear this. It's fine if you don't know something... he will explain it in detail. It keeps you paying attention. Don't skip class or you will fall behind.",
      "Knowledgeable, professional, and engaging. Interactive with the students. He will ask questions on a random students as he writes code. Group work on a web project and learning about python/SQL/javascript. You will learn a lot about coding practices. Daily quizzes can be hard. Tests are fairly easy. Weekly blogs.",
      "I didn't read the textbook much, but I usually liked the articles he provided. It isn't difficult to get points for doing relatively minor tasks like attending class, working with a partner, and writing a weekly blog post. You will get called on frequently in class, but he'll lead you to the answer without making you feel bad about it.",
      "Downing is probably one of my most favorite professors. Although I've already done most of the stuff in the iDB project, I felt like I learned a lot just by being in class. Would highly recommend. He's a really passionate, caring professor, and anyone who takes him is beyond fortunate.",
      "Awesome class to prepare for interviews and internships. Downing is amazingly organized; lectures are routine and well prepared. He is also exceptional at explaining CS concepts and makes it easy to grasp. But definitely be prepared to work.",
      "Dr. Downing loves teaching this class. He always has a quiz for the first 5 minutes of the lecture, the quiz pertains to the last lecture, the readings, or just an attendance quiz. Beware of the cold calls during lecture, he calls on people randomly to answer a series of questions.",
      "Prof Downing is a great lecturer. The cold-calling is unfamiliar at first but keeps your attention in check. Definitely learned a lot in this course",
      "Professor Downing is great and his class is one of the most useful classes in the CS department! Everything we learn is practical and can be translated to an internship/job. The project uses tools that are well known. I think this class is a great way to get ready for an internship/job especially if you haven't done one before.",
      "Downing is one of the best CS professors at UT. You have to take at least one of his classes before graduating. He explains things clearly and makes sure to involve every student in the discussion.",
      "I think every CS student should take Downing's SWE class if they want to become a software engineer one day. You learn really useful skills and get the opportunity to work in a team. Also a great class if you want to learn Python in-depth. Definitely time consuming and challenging though.",
      "Great class, you learn about a lot of different web tools and frameworks, as well as Python, Javascript, and SQL. There are quizzes in every lecture, and these add up, so review the notes. Tests are hard but manageable if you study. The semester-long project requires a decent amount of effort, so make sure you have a good group.",
      "Professor Glenn Downing is overall a nice person and a great lecturer. The group project about developing a database website is real world, fun to work on, and rewarding in terms of self-education and worthy of showing a future employer. The tests are quite difficult and are very unforgiving if you mess up. Redemption from a mistake is difficult!",
      "I enjoyed Professor Downing's Software Engineering course thoroughly. I personally think this is as close as it gets to getting a feel for the industry process/standard of software engineering. Downing's lectures are clear and to-the-point, and his cold calls are nothing to be afraid of. Everything discussed is practical and easy to understand.",
      "The Software Engineering course he teaches is great and definitely worth taking! I would recommend taking it with people you know because most of the projects are group projects and you want a good group. Class engagement is a must because he randomly calls on students to answer questions, but walks you through it if you don't know it.",
      "His lectures are engaging. He is kind with his students when he teaches, and doesn't give off a &quot;I'm the professor and you're the student so I'm superior&quot; vibe. We used a lot of different frameworks and stacks in our projects, and I learned some of the complexities of Python, JavaScript, and SQL.",
      "Prof. Downing's lectures are incredibly helpful and provide tons of clarification for the topics he covers. The first few projects are great for getting accustomed to the way he wants you to set up the projects and beginning to use C++. The later projects (looking at you, Darwin/Life) definitely pick up on difficulty but it's definitely doable!",
      "Honestly this was one of the best, if not the best class I've taken at UT! I'd definitely take another class with Prof. Downing. The class was very well organized and defined. It was excellent!",
      "Great Lecturer, he calls on students randomly to answer questions so you always have to be ready to answer. The projects are very consistent with the coursework but the readings are not.",
      "Definitely a good lecturer, prof Downing tries his best to make sure everyone follows whatever he is teaching. He teaches very practical and useful C++ stuff. Attend lecture, do the projects with a partner, reading assignments don't seem that important.",
      "Great lectures and fair projects. Watch out the coding exams.",
      "He is a great lecturer, his socratic method engages students in lecture. Daily quizzes are really hard some times but he only counts 30 out of 43 (including extra credit quizzes and attendance quizzes every now and then). He offers extra credit if you work with a partner for each assignment (except for the first one). Tests can be hard though.",
      "There are quizzes every class, so you shouldn't skip lecture. I didn't like how he would randomly call on people in class. Material covered in lectures wasn't really related to the group projects. You still learn a lot overall from doing the projects.",
      "OOP was a great class to learn about C++. You really become familiar with the many gotchas of the language as well as differences between it and Java. Quizzes can be tough, but he drops many quizzes at the end. Just make sure to show up on time each class.",
      "Professor Downing's lectures are very engaging and worthwhile. If you do take the class, make sure to get there on time because he has a quiz at the beginning of each class!",
      "Good course to take. A lot of work to do in this course. The difficulties somehow depend on how hard your groupmates work.",
      "Professor Downing is an amazing lecturer. He constantly keeps the class engaged. You learn everything you'll need to know about C++ in a great environment. The projects are not too difficult. The quizzes can be very hard but aren't worth too much. Tests are manageable; they used to be much more difficult but have been made more reasonable.",
      "Solid prof. Python and SQL sections were very useful, refactoring not-so-much. I wish refactoring could be replaced with learning React in class. Assignments were fair and I learned a lot. However it takes forever to get grades back. Tools covered were very useful but too many pointless things like creating GH issues. Hit character count.",
      "There is a gap between lectures and projects that you will need to learn on your own. If that's fine with you, then you will like this class.",
      "I disliked how divorced the lectures were from the projects. It seemed like the lectures were simply there so that the course could be called a class, and the direction of the class was not clear. I would have appreciated the lectures more if they had been focused on practical, project-related topics (ex. user stories, fundamental tools, etc.).",
      "The best lecture I ever have. The quiz is giving to make sure you have understood the materials before the next lecture. The note is giving after class and detail enough. He makes each class so interactive and inspires students by asking some questions during each class. He pours full of his energy and passion in his class. I highly recommend him.",
      "Professor Downing is a great lecturer, very organized and always has a purpose behind what he requires of his students. I would be mindful of what other classes you take along with this one. I felt the class was overall fair, but it takes a lot of your time and Downing will make you work for a good grade. I felt I learned a lot from the class.",
      "Prof. Downing's lectures are definitely the highlight of the class. I always learned something new and interesting from them. The quizzes and tests can be tricky, but there are plenty of freebies and extra-credit opportunities for quizzes to make up for it. The main group project is a full-stack website which you'll have to work pretty hard for.",
      "Professor Downing is an amazing lecturer, definitely a class worth taking. You learn the intricacies of Python and some SQL, and the project for the whole semester is building a website with a group. The quizzes are hard, so definitely try not to skip class. Grading is fair. The class is a lot of work, but it is 100% worth it.",
      "One of the best professors at UT. Definitely one of the 'must take' optional courses",
      "Downing is a great professor! His lectures are quite interesting and you want to make sure you pay attention because that is what most of the quizzes and test questions are going to be over. You will also build your own website as a group project. This class requires a lot of effort, but is definitely worth it.",
      "Downing's classes aren't easy. You need to put the work in, but they are definitely a worthwhile learning experience. I highly recommend taking his classes while you can!",
      "Excellent course and easily one of the best professors I have taken in the CS department. I wish I could provide some sort of criticism, but it is hard to find any. The level of professionalism found throughout this course is a blessing.",
      "He calls on people all the time, but you get used to it",
      "Great professor. He really tries to make his class the best it can possibly be. Read, show up to class, start the projects on time, and everything will be ok. Nothing about this class is there to &quot;get you&quot; or lead you into a mistake.",
      "Really fun class that I learned a lot about during the projects. We had to use a variety of different tools to help us that I didn't know about beforehand which was really interesting. There's also a huge disconnect between the projects and the coursework so be prepared to take the initiative on your own to learn about the tools.",
      "Professor Downing definitely knows his stuff. I learned a great deal in this course, and I would recommend this class to any Computer Science student. There are 5 projects, and at the start of class there are daily quizzes. However, he gives you all the tools you need to be successful in the class.",
      "Reading is due every week, quizzes every class, and he calls on people in class, although if you don't know the answer, he's nice about it. The group project is very time consuming. He's a good lecturer and is good at explaining the confusing parts of the material.",
      "Downing is great at lecturing and you will learn a lot about C++. You also learn a lot about industry tools and it is generally just a good class to take. You don't learn much OOP, although we are taught many OOP concepts already in our intro courses at UT.",
      "Really amazing class to take. Quizzes every lecture about readings and previous lectures, so skipping is not an option. Cold calls on people every lecture, something I didn't like but got used to. He really knows his stuff. Overall, I enjoyed his class and would take him again, even if that means I'll be cold called again.",
      "The lecture is pretty good; the material is extremely useful for interviewing/software engineering jobs. Staying on top of the quizzes can be difficult if you want to receive an A because, despite the drops, he has a limited window for A's. Also, you *have* you make sure you're on a good team because he won't help you much if you have a deadweights",
      "I really enjoyed Downing's class it was super interesting and the projects were pretty informative imo. The first project was a bit tough but the semester long one was cool. Make sure you read and stay on top of it with the quizzes but if you work hard you'll be golden",
      "Passionate professor who seeks to prepare his students for industry. Has a very unique, methodical and logical lecture style that helps to introduce and reinforce concepts. His classes (CS371p and CS373) have heavy workloads and are group-based, so make sure you make time for them and START EARLY ON THE PROJECTS. Overall, learned a lot.",
      "Taking a Glenn Downing course is something that every UTCS major that is interested in getting into the software engineering field must do. In class you learn about python, OOP principles, SQL, and java. The large group project (IDB) is all web development to be done in python Flask for the back end and Javascript React for the front end.",
      "I give Prof. Downing a 5-star. He gives out all his passion for making sure everyone in the class to get as much as he/she can in every single class he teaches. He is one of the kinds that he has solid knowledge of the domain he teaches and full of experience on how to convey it to you. You will love his classes and I highly recommend him to you.",
      "Great professor with a clear interest in the subject material. Not too sure why we had the textbook though because although it was assigned reading, it never came up in anything. Best CS professor I've had yet at UT",
      "Great guy, super helpful when you have a question and willing to listen to make sure he understands where your understanding might be flawed. 10/10 best professor at UT",
      "Excellent course. Group projects are crazy hard, but very good for learning. You get out what you put into it, and you have a lot of freedom.",
      "Good balance between a self-taught group project for the duration of the class, with lectures on a variety of tools and languages. I would have preferred a bit of the reverse, with instruction focusing more on proper software engineering practices, and on how to use the tools required for our projects, but it was a good class overall.",
      "The class is primarily a means of building a full web app with your group. If you want to learn React, SQL, Python, and Flask (and have the time to build out the entire stack) this class is for you.",
      "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning the details of how C++ works and find reasons why it's usually better than Java. I feel that we didn't learn much about OOP fundamentals, but I do feel much more confident when I write code in C++ after taking this class. Dr. Downing is extremely knowledgeable and very helpfu",
      "This is my second time taking Downing's class. Once for OOP and another for SWE (current class). Overall, Downing is a fantastic professor that really loves teaching and staying current on new technologies that appear in the field. For job preparation, Downing is a must.",
      "This is probably the best professor and class I've taken at UT. The group project was incredibly relevant to working in the industry today. Graduating with a degree in CS from UT without taking this course would be a mistake.",
      "I took OOP class, and it was great! He cares the future recruiter expectations which mean all course material and tools we use are really practical. The projects were done by two except the first one. I learned the importance and advantages of team projects.",
      "The projects require the use of many tools; if you've had an internship then you'll fare better in this class. The tests and quizzes have very specific questions so be aware of what concepts are stressed in class and on the quizzes. Find a good team and you'll be fine.",
      "Class was work intensive, mostly working on the projects. Projects are very useful and you make something you can showcase. Enjoyed working as part of a team, happy with the product.",
      "A great class to take for those wanting to enter the software developing field.",
      "Quizzes are rough but there is extra credit quizzes to help offset that.",
      "Great lecturer, he's well-prepared and posts class notes and examples online. I've gained a solid understanding of the languages and concepts he teaches in class because his examples are clear and he gets right to the point. He gives a quiz at the beginning of each lecture and you have to be in class to get the code to unlock it.",
      "Professor Downing is hands down one of the best professors at UT. However, he'll make you work for your grade. If you're really good at tricky multiple choice tests, you'll probably do fine. For SWE, be prepared to work with a group in many different disciplines. Web development is not particularly easy, especially in a class setting.",
      "Dr. Downing is a great professor. He is very knowledgeable about the material and is very thorough during his lectures, providing detailed explanations for everything he says. The projects can be difficult, but you learn a lot doing them and they aren't as time consuming as other CS classes. There are also daily quizzes, so you need to go to class.",
      "I'd suggest taking this class if you haven't had your first internship or are particularly interested in web dev. Otherwise materials are similar to what you have at a job. Pick your groups very carefully. This is not as hard as OS but it may take as much time if you want to build a great product. This is NOT a class to take off your startup idea.",
      "Downing is a great professor. He's passionate about what he's teaching and is clear with the way the course is organized. There are daily quizzes and a group project for the whole semester. Pay attention during lectures, he cold-calls people.",
      "Downing is a wonderful professor. Knows what he is talking about and is very organized with the way he structures the course. There are daily quizzes and a group project for the course",
      "Take Downing during your time at UT if possible. He is such a great lecturer, and an insanely smart professor.",
      "I highly recommend you take a course by Glenn Downing before graduating from UTCS While there are some downsides to his courses (quizzes every class, difficult projects), the lectures and exposure to new tools and modern workflows is worth it. Downing cares about his students and wants everyone to learn and be successful.",
      "A great professor -- he is very organized, and his lectures are clear and concise. He provides notes from each lecture and is quick to respond to any questions from students. The course is a bit time-consuming -- it involves daily quizzes over lectures/readings, active participation during class, 2 exams, and several 5-6 person group projects.",
      "Quizzes at the start of each class. They can be tricky, but he drops a few, and offers bonus quizzes if you go to certain events. Good lecturer.",
      "Good professor, he gives quizzes at the beginning of the class so if you are not on time you will miss the quiz. He also calls people to answer his questions rather than lecturing alone.",
      "Great professor. He provides a lot of useful resources that are very helpful in preparing for a job/internship. The daily quizzes can be a little challenging but the exams closely follow the format of the quizzes so they're pretty useful. As long as you go to class and pay attention, you should be fine. The projects are a bit time consuming.",
      "You will learn a lot in this course if you take an active roll. Be sure to actually study for the daily quizzes. The content in lecture is pretty dissociated from the project. Lectures are pretty dry, but he keeps you engaged by cold-calling, which kept me from zoning out. The project was rewarding given that you have a product at the end of it.",
      "Downing is an awesome lecturer, but he is a brutal grader. I love taking his classes because I enjoy the way he teaches, but that often won't translate to your grade. Think long and hard about what you want out this class. If you want a good grade, probably best to pass, but if you want a valuable experience, give it a shot.",
      "This class is super useful for learning development techniques and tools, but doesn't do much in the way of teaching you how to be a 'good' web developer. You're always working against a deadline, and on top of the stress, the lectures are more in line with OOD, not full-stack dev. Expect to learn most everything your grades depend on yourself.",
      "I have had the great opportunity to take 2 classes with Prof. Downing. He really focuses on very practical information along with good theory and design practice. His lectures are very entertaining and I enjoy his Moore Method of explaining topics. My only gripe is the reading, it seems useful, but I never read them until test time.",
      "Group projects due every 2 weeks. Each project was built on top of the other and the final product was a dynamic website. Quizzes every day in the first 5 minutes of class.",
      "A few important points - attendance is required, the course requires significant mental energy, and it will be time consuming. It should not be difficult to get a good grade if you are engaged with the class, but for more independent learners and those that do not do well with strict organization and oversight this may not work out well for you.",
      "One of the best professors at UT. All of this professor's courses are worth taking and you will come out knowing so much more about the subject. Would highly recommend.",
      "Excellent lectures with student participation. Cadence and diction are a cross between Penn Jillette and Wallace Shawn's Vizzini. Requires laptop for tests, which has coding via HackerRank. Textbook not used. Daily quizzes. Projects straightforward with clear grading criteria. Introduces many useful tools for software design. Take his course!",
      "Professor Downing gave out his best experience and knowledge to this class. He put his full enthusiasm in each lecture. One of the many best things was he made the class so interactive and vivid. I love this class and love to have other classes from him in the future.",
      "Awesome class, went from knowing nothing about C++ to making it my language of choice. You definitely need to go to class, and the final is significantly harder than the midterm. Just study, go over the quizzes, go to class, ask questions. Hugely rewarding class.",
      "Staying attentive in class is the best preparation for the quizzes, and the quizzes are essential in preparing for the tests.",
      "Prof. Downing is an excellent lecturer. I guarantee you'll learn a lot. The workload is high, so you'll most likely end up working nights and weekends to finish his projects, but you do get a partner, which helps. I had a lot of trouble with the tests and quizzes, which is unusual for me. There is lots of extra credit, though, so it evens out.",
      "I took this class as my last class at UT. I had previously had 4 software engineering internships and I can say that this class more closely resembles what software engineering is like in the real world than any other class I took. It has an extremely high workload, so I don't recommend taking it with other difficult CS classes.",
      "Great lecturer and you learn quite a lot in the class. Some of those things aren't taught directly by him, though that's kind of the point. I feel like I would have liked this class a lot more had I not taken it over the summer. Don't go in with expectations because it appears that a lot of class's rules/guidelines are subject to change.",
      "I am definitely glad I took his class. I learned a lot. It was a lot of work.",
      "A very good C++ course",
      "A very good course if you want to learn Python and web development.",
      "Downing is a great teacher. He really makes you work especially during the summer course but its a great experience and you will learn alot. If you're seeking a future in web development I highly recommend taking this course!",
      "Take the class if you are new to web development. If you put in the effort, you will be able to learn a lot about the front end, the back end and how every fits together in the \"story\" that he talks about so much. (P.S. All textbooks able to be found online if you are a broke college student)",
      "Pretty tough course, but you will walk out of this class with a much better grasp of software fundamentals. He is a solid lecturer, he will call directly on you in class and ask you questions about the current topic in a conversational manner. The projects take a LOT of time, especially if you have no background in web development, so start early!",
      "Generic Programming with Prof. Downing has been one of my favorite classes I've taken at UT. Prof. Downing is VERY precise with the word choice describing C++ constructs and he teaches by having conversations with students about code examples. If you want to become a better programmer, take one of his classes before you graduate.",
      "CS 371G Generic Programming is only offered during the summers as a 9 week course, and I would definitely recommend it. This was my first Downing class and I was a bit skeptical, but it was great. From what I can tell, a lot of the projects are the same as some of the OOP projects, so If you have already taken that you have an easy leg up.",
      "Amazing teacher. Quizzes are deadly though. Right at the beginning of class, timed, tricky, and worth 18% of your final grade. Highly recommend taking him though, but don't expect to get an A",
      "Downing is a respected professor. He conveys information clearly and requires daily participation from students. Quick to respond to messages. CS373 taken over the summer was difficult at points. Quizzes are daily and require preparation. Tests require review of every detail of notes, even the seemingly small ones. Projects are time-consuming.",
      "The class is very intensive over the Summer, with constant reviewing of material required if you want a good grade. The group projects depends heavily on the hours you put in, and the effort of your group members. There are daily quizzes which cover material from the previous class, so it is important not to get behind with the lectures.",
      "Engaging lectures Randomly calls on students for lectures, but will walk you through problems if you don't know the answer. Difficult quizzes, but had a few extra credit opportunities (4% points). Tests are pretty easy if you have a good grasp of the material.",
      "Very incisive lectures. Professor Downing elucidates every new concept, and he does his best to make sure no one is left behind. He also is keen on his students getting experience with methodologies and tools used in industry.",
      "Downing makes everything in this class 'crystal-clear', from concepts taught to project requirements. I can honestly say that I enjoyed my time in his class.",
      "Great teacher. The way he teaches CS is different from most professors because demonstrates everything with code and involves students in the lecture. Also, I found learning C++ very valuable.",
      "Take Prof. Downing if you can. His lectures are a great introduction to C++ and is very valuable if you haven't used C++ before. The class allows you to see the differences between Java and C++ and a very thorough explanation on those differences. One of the better CS courses IMO.",
      "A very excellent professor with a great personality and humor. Great at teaching beyond the basics but not going way too far from there. Introduces relevant material and content from industry. As long as you attend class (and read quiz questions carefully), your grade will turn out great. Highly recommend taking for the knowledge and professor.",
      "Downing requires attendance and has daily quizzes, of which he drops 6. Classes are decently entertaining, but can be a bit slow. Extra credit for working in groups on the projects. Tests are extremely detailed and specific.",
      "Definitely one of the best professors at UT. The class isn't very hard as long as you attend all the lectures (which is required anyways, as there is an in-class quiz just about every day)",
      "Professor Downing is an incredibly lecturer and has refined the courses he teaches down to an exact science. You will learn a ton from him and be pushed to learn even more outside of the classroom. Professor Downing is difficult but always fair, and the amount you gain from being part of his class is well worth it.",
      "This is one of the best courses I've taken at UT, and I wish I could take it again. Professor Downing is a great lecturer and although the class is tough, I highly recommend taking it.",
      "Great professor, keeps lectures interesting and makes students stay alert in class by calling on random students to ask questions. Provides lot of information and advice that helps with getting internships and learning about the tech culture.",
      "Downing is arguably one of the best professors in the CS department. It's a very intense class, but you'll enjoy it. He's the only professor who I would get a C from and come back to take a second class.",
      "Probably the best lecturer I've ever had. But his exams were bad, and he didn't give us enough time to finish them. Hard quizzes in every class that cover your comprehension of material thoroughly. Projects take 10-20 hours each, but he gives extra credit for working with partners. Solid professor, but held back by his awful exams.",
      "He knows how to keep a class engaged - lectures are generally worth going to. He also calls on people to ask technical questions, but is chill about it.",
      "Loved the class. Downing is a great lecturer and I enjoyed most of the projects. Two tests, no final. If you score really well on the projects you can still pass even if you do very poorly on the tests. Second test was way harder than the first. Be prepared to have a daily quiz. They start off easy then get really tough.",
      "Really amazing lecturer. So far I can tell the only person who can \"compete\" with him in terms of programming skills is Mike Scott. Quizzes everyday and be prepared to get called in class. Projects aren't too bad but you need to start early; the tests are hard given that you only have a short amount of time to finish them.",
      "Downing has one of the most well structured, engaging, influential teaching styles in all of UT. You are required to come to class on time for mandatory quizzes. He will call on random students during class to bring the entire room in with the lesson. Come to class and be willing to learn C++ and you'll make an A.",
      "Software Engineering with Downing is a great class where you will learn concepts actually applicable to the real world. There are daily quizzes, participation, 2 individual/partner projects, a group project consisting of 3 phases, and 2 tests. Though he may seem intimidating, Downing is actually very understanding and wants students to succeed.",
      "Glenn Downing's OOP class is incredible. If you're looking for good structure in your learning, pick Downing.",
      "He is, hands down, the best professor I've had at UT (and he has some tough competition). His lectures are funny and engaging, his objectives are clear, and his projects have just the right level of length and complexity. The knowledge and inspiration I gained from this course will likely stay with me for years to come."

      "Mike is the quintessential UTCS experience. Encourages you to ask questions. Very important CS topics are covered very well by his lectures; very interesting and rewarding class. If you put in the work, you will become such a better programmer. DON'T THINK ABOUT SLACKING IN THIS CLASS because you won't survive. Fair and clear regarding expectations",
      "He teaches CS 314 better than CS 312, in my opinion. His assignments were mediocre, and he has no quizzes anymore just visit his section to get free points. His exams were difficult, but he did curve/bump the scores for all the exams to make the average at around an 80. Overall, solid lecturer and proper grading criteria.",
      "Very awesome guy, but homework can be tough and is meticulously graded. Overall, a good course.",
      "Mike is an excellent lecturer -- attendance is graded, but it really is worth much more than the points you pick up to go to class. He is funny and a wonderful teacher. He and his TA's are accessible throughout the week to assist with any issues on programs. Lots of programs, and a hard class, but you will be rewarded for the effort you put in.",
      "Mike Scott is a very charismatic lecturer that has his courses (312/314) fine-tuned to perfection. If you are average at programming, he will make your semester stressful and difficult. However, the satisfaction that you get when you go back home over break and work on a project and realize that you are now a god programmer makes it all worth it.",
      "This lecturer is very great. His lectures and interesting and he explains things very well. Attendance is mandatory and there is one quiz every week. His grading is very clearly laid out and tests are not too hard. He posts old tests to use as study material, so preparing for tests is very useful.",
      "Mike is an amazing professor, and it is obvious that he has perfected this class over the years. He has clear grading criteria and his labs, though time-consuming, will make you learn a lot. He has released all of his past exams which you should study with because they are difficult. Although not easy, 314 with Mike has been incredibly rewarding.",
      "Mike is the best professor I have had. Before taking his 312 class, I had no coding experience at all. After that class, I felt somewhat knowledgable, and after 314, I feel significantly more so. He gives is a lot of work, and the tests are honestly pretty hard, but the class is so fun and interesting if you are willing to put in the work.",
      "Mike Scott is a force of nature. Mike Scott is unpredictable. Mike is love. Mike is life. In all seriousness, it was an amazing class. The tests nearly killed me, but I made it. This class was more stressful than working in commercial refrigeration repair, which is largely composed of fifteen-hour days in the blazing sun on someone's roof.",
      "Mike is a great lecturer and explains concepts really well. The assignments are not terrible, just don't wait until the last minute. Also make sure to compare your output with Mike's output as they are really picky about that when grading.",
      "Difficulty if you took CS before: Fairly Easy A. He was a really good lecturer and great at explaining concepts. The assignments were the appropriate length. The amount of effort required was just right. It seems like this class has been fine-tuned to be close to optimal.",
      "Fantastic lectures. Prof. Scott genuinely cares about your learning; him/TAs are very helpful during office hours. Assignments are not too difficult if you put the work in. He provides plenty of exam prep material. Gave me a solid foundation in programming. Overall, a great experience.",
      "An instructor doesn't get any better than this, you just have to put in the work",
      "Fantastic professor, taught fundamentals well.",
      "I left the Computer Science major for a reason, but I still think that he was a good professor. At least he gave engaging lectures and had a sense of humor.",
      "Great professor who keeps lectures interesting and informative.",
      "One of the best professors in introductory Computer Science anywhere. Crisp, clear, and heavily detailed lectures that drive in necessary concepts for you to be able to advance to the next level. Absolutely amazing.",
      "Mike does a really good job making sure you understand Data Structures and basic Java programming well. I've learned a great deal and can immediately apply my knowledge to projects, interviews and internships. You have to work hard in his class and do multiple practice tests to do well, but he grades fairly",
      "Michael Scott is a great lecture, I actually really enjoyed going to class each day. The assignments are doable but take lots time. Spend most of your time studying for tests, they're the majority of the grade. The grades are fair and you can use Mike, TA's and Piazza for help. Download the chrome extension Mike's Got Style to get an A in the class",
      "This is the hardest class in my freshman year. He gives amazing lectures and you can learn a lot of things through his class. Homeworks are time-consuming and graded pretty strict. There are two midterms and a final add up to around 70% of the grade, tests are somewhat difficult. In all, this is a great class but need to take a lot effort.",
      "Study for the exams. The assignments are obviously harder than 312. If you pay attention and do the assignments and study for the exams you should be fine, but stay on top of things.",
      "Mike Scott is a great professor. He is passionate about the field and delivers his lectures well. You'll learn so much from him and the weekly assignments. I would recommend studying for the exams though.",
      "Mike defined my freshman experience. His charisma, well-placed jokes, and patience in teaching data structures indicates that those countless years of lecturing experience have indeed paid off. The grading has a significantly subjective dimension to it, however - but that is taken care of by the TAs.",
      "This class was amazing, although I didn't do the best. I did learn a lot, and Mike's lectures teach you what you need to know. I also really appreciated the labs, although time consuming. Take advantage of the test practice resources. He posts all previous exams he's given and the keys to them. This class, although challenging is really rewarding.",
      "Mike Scott is an amazing teacher/lecturer, and you will learn a lot from him if you take his class. However be warned! This is not a blow-off class, and you better be prepared to spend quite a lot of time doing his programming assignments and studying for his tests.",
      "I skipped 312 and went straight into 314. This class was a difficult transition between high school to college, as points can easily be lost from small mistakes on quizzes, labs, and tests. But Mike is a great professor, and you will learn a lot from his class. There is almost always someone holding office hours during the week.",
      "Mike Scott's data structures class is great. While it isn't easy, he provides so many resources to help you succeed. The TAs are very accessible for help on programming assignments, and each assignment is useful and relevant to the class. While his lectures sometimes didn't feel totally focused on the most important material, they are still helpful",
      "Mike's lectures are amazing but the class itself is a mixed bag. If you have no cs experience coming in, you're going to have to do a lot of outside practice to catch up to others in the class. The class has three tests which count for 65% of your grade so you'll have to focus a bunch on those. And go to office hours if you ever need extra help.",
      "Very nice lecturer!",
      "he gives amazing lectures and his tests are not hard, plus he gives some extra points",
      "Learned a lot in this class and spent the most time on it by far compared to the rest of my classes. The assignments are time-consuming but easy to do well on, and the quizzes are not graded very harshly. However, the tests were very hard for me but passable if you put in the time to study. Don't buy the book use the 3 edition which is free online.",
      "Great teacher. Lectures are engaging and organized. Assignments are interesting and drive home the concept at hand. He's a nice guy, just take his class seriously and be respectful.",
      "Best CS teacher I've ever had.",
      "Great lecturer and easy-going guy. Lots of online resources to help you prepare for tests and coding assignments. Only thing I didn't like was that we had to write unnecessary tests for our code, and that felt like busywork.",
      "One of the best teachers I have ever seen or had. Lectures are very thought provoking and fun to listen to. One of his best traits is his ability to explain abstract concepts in a clear way. If you have the chance, do yourself a favor and take him.",
      "Mike Scott is a very genuine guy, I personally enjoyed his lecturing, he was funny, and also good at explaining things. Most of the things you learn however are going to be through the homework since that is really where we practice the concepts that we learn in class. The TA's and Mike Scott are pretty much always available to help though!",
      "Mike Scott is a fantastic lecturer and really cares that his students' understand what he is teaching. You will definitely learn the knowledge needed for the workforce. This class however is quite difficult and will require a lot of work outside of class to do well in. Then again, you probably didn't choose CS cause it was easy :)",
      "Great teacher 10/10 would take again",
      "I absolutely loved taking Mike's class. He was a great lecturer and you can tell he really cares about the material and helping students understand it. I did go into the class with some prior knowledge of the course content but the way he taught and assigned work allowed me to learn and grow as a programmer anyhow. Would highly recommend!",
      "Amazing professor, I started off with no experience in CS and I have learned so much. He's super awesome at explaining concepts to beginners like me and he's a really sweet guy. Be warned though, his class won't be easy, you will have to put a lot of effort in it (at least if you had no previous experience in CS312).",
      "Mike is a fantastic lecturer and really helps you understand the material, despite the speed with which he teaches. He's pretty funny, and overall a really nice guy and professor. His assignments are challenging, but there's always plenty of help so you never have to struggle alone.",
      "Mike Scott is one of the best teachers I've ever had. He's an amazing lecturer and willing to help students. I'd done some CS before and didn't find his class hard. He focuses a lot on \"clean code\" and is really good at teaching the basics and how to write nice, readable code. Tests are definitely lecture based and attendance is a grade.",
      "He is a very knowledgeable lecturer, and is very clear in what he expects out of your work.",
      "Mike Scott is the best. He's so passionate about teaching, and it shows in his lectures. You do have to put in the effort, but what you learn in this class is SO important. He gives you all the past test so you know exactly what he is going to test over, and there are many resources for you to do well on the projects as well.",
      "Great teacher",
      "Engaging lectures and not at all condescending.",
      "lectures were sometimes pretty boring. homework took so long and tests were tough. i didn't really enjoy the class but that's just me.",
      "Amazing lecturer, well designed projects that teach you the material well. The tests are very similar to the in class examples as well as the projects. Very, very helpful at office hours.",
      "Has great lectures and his projects are well designed. The projects do a good job of helping you learn to apply the material. Tests are all pencil and paper so they can be difficult, but there are plenty of review materials (including past tests) so they're manageable if you work hard.",
      "Amazing professor. Difficult grader and you have to work hard to keep up with the class, but in the end, you learn quite a lot. Tests are hard, entirely hand-written, and mostly problem solving based.",
      "Good explanations, makes sure you understand. Lectures were never boring, so this class was my favorite class of the semester. Overall, VERY interesting and intelligent man.",
      "Mike Scott is the best teacher I have taken at the University. I took him for both 314 and 312, and honestly he just made every class so fun. He has a great personality and he'll have you laughing at just about everything he says. He's also an incredible teacher. He explains things so well that I never needed to take notes or read a book.",
      "Great teacher and super engaging.",
      "Great professor. Don't be afraid of him and go to office hours to ask any questions (he's super helpful). Textbook not needed but can be used as further reference. Grading of coding assignments depends on your TA (some are tougher than others). Exams are graded pretty tough by both TAs and Mike. You'll learn a lot. 1010 would recommend.",
      "You have to study and do the homework (on your own without any help). Other than that great professor. Entertaining and helpful. However like all the professors in UTCS they are very much bureaucrats who guard their right to grading like it is sacrosanct.",
      "He's seriously such a great teacher. He really knows how to explain CS concepts, even to those who have never programmed before. He is also EXTREMELY nice in office hours. Projects can be time consuming but the class is manageable. TY Mike for 2 awesome semesters.",
      "A great professor overall, good at explaining and very willing to help. You will need to work for your grade though and expect to spend some time studying and programming, especially if you haven't worked with data structures before!",
      "He is the best CS 312 and CS 314 professor. Projects due every week but they are useful and he will always help you. TAKE HIM!",
      "Mike is a fantastic lecturer; he somehow manages to make data structures interesting, communicates clearly, and keeps the atmosphere pleasant with his engaging personality. Genuinely a helpful, friendly guy. Beware, however, that his assignments can be somewhat long and tedious at times.",
      "Mike is a good teacher, his lectures are very helpful and informative and he explains things well. However, you need to put a lot of effort into this class if you have never programmed before. The later assignments can be difficult and will take up time. Office hours are very helpful if you're stuck.",
      "Mike is an awesome lecturer and will answer questions as best he can. He fcuses mainly on software development more than theory. He has clicker questions in class that are participation but aren't worth much in terms of your whole grade. Mike really cares about his students and it shows, especially if you see him during lab hours.",
      "I loved Mike's class! He was clear in his expectations and grading. His lectures had a logical, geeky-type humor to it. You have to put a lot of work in the class if you have never programmed before (or if you have never done Java), but Mike makes sure you learn everything. I recommend going to his lab hours, as it will make the class easier.",
      "Mike is a fantastic teacher. Super helpful and tirelessly available. The class is challenging but interesting. He really strives to make the content relatable and entertaining. Strongly recommend.",
      "He's a great teacher. The assignments weren't short, but they were worthwhile and fun. He's the kind of teach where I didn't even have to take notes; his lectures were interesting enough for me to just listen and absorb the information.",
      "He gives extra credit from the iClicker for going to class which is very helpful. This class is tough although you will know data structures well. He is a bit harsh on grading, no regrades. That being said, he is very helpful if you do not understand something and ask him in office hours.",
      "The topics in the class are well presented in class. The lectures are entertaining and stimulating. The projects through the semester will teach you a lot although they were, more often than not, way too excessive. The coding didn't make them excessive, it was the required test cases and experiments. This class is A LOT of work!",
      "His class really made me like programming. Granted, it was rather difficult, and he's a little intimidating to approach during office hours, but he's funny and very to the point. It is a hard class though. It totally a weed out class for the major.",
      "He is a great professor, and is lots of fun to listen to. Makes sure that everyone understands as long as you ask.",
      "Mike is a fun guy. Overall a good teacher; the workload is reasonable and he puts all his old tests for reviewing. It's important that you get a nice TA though, because mine was terrible and took off lots of points for irrelevant stuff on the assigments.",
      "Very good teacher, lots of homework but they definetly help you out and make you learn the material, old tests are online so they you can prepare-best idea ever.",
      "While the first half of the course is very primitive (variables, functions, oo) for anyone with ANY CS experience, the second half is a good refresher for data structures. The assignments increase in difficulty, but are always manageable. Mike is a very talented lecturer, and explains things well to people who don't already know the material.",
      "coupled with the right TA, easy A if you just show up and do the work, provided of course you also understand what's going on. definitely entertaining and very good at breaking down where you are comming from when asking a question so you get a relivant answer that helps you to understand.",
      "Great teacher, fun to learn from.",
      "No Comments",
      "He was a great teacher and very happy to teach. His patience is without bounds and he keeps all his power points online for easy referral. Plus, all his old tests are online so it's great practice for tests. Start assignments early and do the practice tests before the exams!",
      "this course is very hard, don't get me wrong, mike is a good teacher, his class is pretty interesting but cs isn't for me so therefore made it very hard. there are programs due everywk on fridays and he has 3 exams and a final.exams/finals consist of coding questions and some mc questions.",
      "Mike is enthusiastic about the material and obviously enjoys teaching. Recommended. You will need to invest time outside of class to complete the assignments.",
      "Hey what can you say against a guy who throws candy out when you respond to his questions&#63;",
      "Programming assignments are pretty difficult. In-class lectures are reasonable. Instructor is very attentive to questions and comments.",
      "Articulates difficult concepts easily. Assignments are challenging. Exams are fair.",
      "Somewhat easy class; has a time commitment. Some of the projects are hard."

      "Mitra is an excellent professor, very knowledgeable in his field and an engaging lecturer. His CS313E class is significantly harder than CS303E and it requires several hours of coding a week for homework assignments. Be prepared to attend almost every lecture and put in a lot of work to excel in this class, but it is rewarding.",
      "Walked into this class thinking it was going to be the hardest thing ever, I wasn't wrong but I can definitely my coding skills and critical thinking skills have improved tremendously. You learn a lot and he teaches really well. for the lectures that I missed, I was always confused. TAs might hoe you on hws but you can just go to them for help",
      "2 assignments a week, 3 exams, readings, and daily quizzes. If you stay on top of things you'll succeed. I usually spent about 1-2 hours per assignment, but ymmv. Mitra truly cares about you learning, and if you are willing to put in the work to get better, you will improve vastly. The grading can be harsh, but you learn to make less mistakes.",
      "Dr. Mitra teaches with passion and believes in his students. The homework is tough, and you should expect to spend many hours a week working on it, but it is doable if you put in the effort. Daily quizzes based on class content, 3 exams, 2 homeworks per week. This was one of the most challenging classes Ive taken, but it was definitely worth it.",
      "Mitra was enthusiastic and genuinely excited to teach. His class is difficult, but the TA's were great and easy to reach. Two programs assigned a week and three written tests. He encourages pair programming, so program homework can be done with a partner. Attendance is mandatory because every class starts with a 3 minute quiz!m",
      "The class is very work intensive, be prepared to work your ass off in order to pass. Two programmings assignments a week, one due Monday night and the other Friday night. The grading on the homework can be a little unfair due to how much effort you put into it so at times you may feel cheated in a sense. Mitra is an excellent professor though.",
      "Mitra is a wonderful professor who makes class interesting. I had him for both CS303 and CS313 which is why I was drawn to take this class. You learn a great deal in this course, but be ready for a heavy workload. If you stay on top of assignments and attend class you should do well in the course.",
      "Two programming assignments per week, simple quizzes based on last lecture every lecture, and occasional online reading assignments which are free grades. Tests are fairly doable, mostly closely related to the homework and generally simpler than homework. Relatively a lot of work but Dr. Mitra is a great professor with good lectures and feedback",
      "He's an honest and fair professor who, on the first day of class, told us to refer to the reviews that you see here. The class is a huge time commitment. Assignments are tricky and difficult, and so are the tests. Expect to be coding for at least nine hours a week. Grade distribution on Catalyst looks nice only because so many people drop.",
      "Dr. Mitra is a very great professor!!! His class was very organized and valuable.",
      "Dr. Mitra is a great professor, and really does want you to learn the material. His assignments are tough, but they make you work to understand the concepts. Tests also hard, but in the end, he also gets that it's an elements class, and is not trying to destroy your grade. Perfect balance between difficulty of course, and grade received.",
      "Mitra explains things well but there are so many assignments! You have to really put in time for this class or you ain't gonna pass. Exams are very difficult and lengthy (my wrist cramped up multiple times) but he gives partial credit. I learned a lot but I also stressed a lot. All in all, it was a good experience. I'm dreading taking the final :",
      "I took Mitra for web development and for the CS 303E class. By the end of the class you will have learned a lot, seriously. If you want to get more into CS then Mitra is the professor you want to take. Getting a good grade is easy as long as you do your work and stay on top of assignments.",
      "Dr. Mitra is an outstanding professor. He communicates very well with his students and always gives difficult, yet reasonable, assignments that force you to struggle with the course material. One of the best and most educational classes I've taken at UT Austin so far. Definitely take a CS course with Mitra if you can!",
      "Mitra is great! A class worth taking. He explains things very well and is funny too.",
      "Let me let you in on a secret. You will cry. But then you'll get with the program and learn a hell of a lot. I have taken 2 classes (303E and 313E) with prof Mitra and despite being one of the tougher professors I've had, he doesn't give you anything you can't do. He's reasonable and honestly, one of the best professors I've had at UT Austin.",
      "I have taken 303E &amp; 313E with Mitra and loved both. Learn a bit about the language before class starts, because he will only really skim over it while stressing the logic, algorithms, and concepts. Also, don't be too discouraged if you don't do too well on his exams; most don't, just keep at it. Great teacher, funny and enthusiastic every day!",
      "Mitra is a really cool professor overall. He explains everything very thoroughly and engages his students during the lecture. He might throw some jokes here and there. Also, if you ask questions dumb questions he might roast you during class.",
      "Prof. Mitra is fine. I learned a lot in his class(OOP, turtle graphics, sorting algorithm, heaps, stack, queue, linked list, tree, graph ...). But you have to strictly follow the rubric if you want a decent grade for assignment. Don't name the variables yourself, I got 3 0s because of variable names.",
      "Forreal, if you skip this class you won't pass. There's about two assignments every week (even due on Saturdays and Sundays) and you get to work with a partner on most of them. They're way harder compared to 303E, so don't start on them the day before. Some TAs are helpful. Tests are hard. Worth it because recruiters like it. Good luck.",
      "The second class I've taken with Mitra, it's been the hardest classes I've ever taken, but he really is an amazing professor. It is a lot of work but you will learn so much.",
      "hes a really good lecturer",
      "Professor Mitra is a great professor. I took Introduction to Web Programming with him. He was always available and helpful during office hours. He only cares about you learning the material. He is very concerned about his students success.",
      "I love Mitra. He's super cool and really funny--the biggest issue for me is the workload for this class. I highly recommend taking the course but get ready to spend a lot of time on homework. Overall, I'm glad that I took it. I admire that Mitra respects all disciplines and sometimes does some good roasting.",
      "Dr. Mitra definitely teaches a difficult class, but I thought it was a worthwhile experience. He wants his students to succeed. I took three classes with him (303E, 313E, and 329E) and I learned a lot! He's a great professor. Just be prepared to do ALL the homework, and the tests should be straightforward.",
      "Mitra is an amazing professor. As a beginner programmer (I started in his 303 class), I thought he taught the basics of coding in an understandable way. If you are serious about learning coding, his class is probably the best to take. Tests and assignments are difficult/time consuming but are beneficial in the long-run.",
      "Mitra is one of the best professors I've had here at UT. He genuinely cares about his students and making sure the class is a worthwhile learning experience. He assigns a lot of HW but each assignment has been beneficial to my overall programming knowledge and I'm really glad he gave us so much work.",
      "took dr. mitra for both CS303E and CS313E, and it's definitely been two of the most worthwhile classes I've taken here. it's certainly very assignment-heavy, so expect at least one or two assignment a week. i've learned a lot about programming these two semesters, and if you work for it, you should too!",
      "He is awesome!! You learn so much from him, and he makes class enjoyable.",
      "Great professor! He makes you do a lot of homeworks, but you learn so so much and it isn't hard to get a good grade either if you can keep up.",
      "Mitra is one of my favorite professor's I have ever had. Both his 303 and 313E class are beyond doable... he just really wants students to understand the topics of the class and how to algorithmically think both in and out of the class . Exams are not bad, cheat sheets allowed... programming assignments hold alot of weight in your grade. 10/10",
      "He's an awesome professor. Really made me want to learn more about CS. I thought that I wasn't really capable of programming but he really changed that for me. If you're doubting you really shouldn't.",
      "Good professor. Hard class",
      "Mitra is a really knowledgeable professor. He is also pretty chill. Much respect for him. Element of Software Design is basically Data Structures so expect challenging material through the coursesuch as working with Linked Lists. Overall, I highly recommend him and he is indeed our advisor for the Elements of Computing prog. / &quot;CS Minors&quot;.",
      "Mitra is very intelligent and committed. Lots of assignments but it is very manageable.",
      "Mitra is the GOAT",
      "Dr. Mitra may be my favorite professor at UT so far. He is very good at explaining complex concepts, and he clearly knows what he's doing. If you go to the lectures, read the textbook, and apply the knowledge to the assignments you should do just fine. The tests, while difficult, are doable.",
      "Dr. Mitra does an excellent job at making CS understandable for all students and relates material back to how it can be practically used. On top of how well I think he does his job, he definitely shows he cares for his students. He is some what an unofficial advisor for the computing certificate-- I assume he took this on seeing we don't have one.",
      "LOVED the prof. He is so caring and funny. Lots of homework, but the knowledge I gained will carry on for a long time. Go to office hours for assignments, there are a lot of them. Tests were fair, we got to bring a cheat sheet. Definitely enjoyed the class, it is applicable for so many things.",
      "Dr. Mitra is fantastic. Computer science is not supposed to be easy, so expect to do a lot of studying/doing extra problems on your own. His pop-quizzes usually consist of a coding problem and a logic problem which get you to think in a problem-solving mindset. Tests are fairly difficult, but your HW grade can carry you. You've got to take Mitra!",
      "Great professor! If you do all the homework, then you'll be fine. Tests made up only 45% of the grade. The assignments are pretty hard, but if you do them and understand them, then you won't really need to study much for the exams. His first test was his hardest, and I got a 58 on it, yet I still got an A.",
      "I came into this class with no coding background, and I would say that this class is not easy. There were many coding assignments and homework exercises, and the assignments got a lot more difficult as the semester went on. I personally enjoyed this class and I think it's not that bad if you put some effort into it.",
      "Professor Mitra is a really approachable guy. He wants his students to understand the concepts and is always open to questions. The assignments are a bit time consuming especially for people with no coding background but they're doable. CS is a difficult subject to teach bc there are so many different ways of approaching it, but he tries his best.",
      "I truly enjoyed taking Mitra's class. He emphasizes the thought process behind the stuff he teaches, and takes time to be clear and thorough with his explanations. That being said, the concepts he does teach are not meant to be easily understood by everyone. If you have little to no background in CS, you will probably have to work harder.",
      "Great lecturer who teaches us to focus more on the logic rather than the code, and tries to make each homework assignment interesting. Really helpful and encourages students to ask questions when they get lost, and also is a pretty funny guy.",
      "Smart guy with a great sense of humor. He can be a little difficult to follow at times, but gladly answers questions in class. I'm taking him for CS313E right now and took his 303E class last semester.",
      "Taking 303E with Mitra is what made me decide to transfer into CS. He's a great professor. He explains things in a very understandable way (I came into the class with 0 knowledge of coding) and loves to answer questions. I always looked forward to his lectures, and that's coming from someone who very rarely is enthusiastic about lectures.",
      "I really liked Mitra for CS 303E. It was a hard class, with lots of assignments, some of which were easy and some of which made me want to rip my hair out. But he's a funny dude and the material is, at least to me, very interesting. So, it's not an easy A class, but if you go to all lectures and work hard, you can make an A and learn a lot!",
      "Probably one of the best professors I'll ever have. Funny guy and a terrific lecturer. Assignments are pretty difficult and or time consuming, but interesting nonetheless. Tests are also really difficult but with a substantial amount of studying, you can do well on them.",
      "Best CS professor I've had. His office hours are popular, but not always the most helpful. Enjoyed lectures, pertinent to assignments.",
      "Wouldn't it be nice if someone else could write the rest of this review? In all seriousness, Dr. Mitra is a great prof, and one you will enjoy for CS303E. He obviously loves Computer Science. Mitra is also a \"Typical\" CS person. Lame jokes, entire lectures on why building a PC is good, etc. If you think of yourself as a CS nerd, you will love him.",
      "Best CS prof ever.",
      "He is an amazing professor. One of the best professors in UT. Yes, his class is hard, but it's completely worth it you will learn a lot.",
      "One of the best professors I've taken at UT. Very helpful and genuinely cares about teaching. You will learn a lot in this class.",
      "After the first quiz I swore I'd never take a class from him again. We had to hand-write an entire program, which is fine, but he hadn't told us to expect that beforehand. He did much better at preparing us for subsequent quizzes. He is a good teacher overall, and I feel like I learn in lecture and from the homework.",
      "CS 312 Introduction to Computer Programming taught by Mitra is a great course, he is extremely clear about what to expect on exams, and the programming homework is reasonable. Attendance is mandatory, an easy 10% of your final grade. Mitra is friendly, approachable, and genuinely cares for his students. I recommend Mitra",
      "CS 303E is a course in computer programming for non-majors. Dr. Mitra is a great professor. His lectures are very clear and straightforward and he tells you exactly what to expect from tests/quizzes with no surprises or tricks. Take him if you can! He's a very reasonable professor."

      "I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Fraij's CS 331 class. He explains the material well and encourages class participation. Furthermore, he is sensitive to students' needs and I've always found him to be kind and patient.",
      "Mr. Fraij has interesting enough lectures given the course and he explains the material thoroughly . Quizzes every class and weekly assignments. Test aren't too hard just study the material and you'll do fine.",
      "Mr. Fraij is awesome. He provide you with the basic tools to be a successful software engineer. I have learned in his class much more than I learned in my other classes in the elements program. But be careful you need to come to class and participate. You need also to be ready for some amount of self learning.",
      "Professor Fraij is the most respected professor in the department. He has a fantastic course that ticks every box on the student evaluations and extends himself beyond structure and scores, and offers opportunities to succeed. In the end you are graded fairly by the effort you put into the class. I advise you pay attention and learn it all!",
      "Dr. Fraij is a pretty good professor overall, hell give an introduction to the class material but you will have to teach yourself. The assignments are quite confusing but going to office hours will help a lot. Exams are very similar to in-class quizzes + readings. There's a lot of extra credit opportunities. Go to class, read, and you'll be fine.",
      "Fraij is a bit of a dull lecturer, but his tests are very fair and easy. The averages on tests are As and quizzes are very 100s as long as you show up to class. He gives you a pdf of the textbook and the homework load is fairly light.",
      "I loved having Fraij for CS 311! He was an amazing professor provided that you were interested in the topic and were willing to learn. Although his lectures can be repetitive or hard to understand, going to office hours really helped and clarified a lot of things. Fraij is really nice and wants his students to succeed. Definitely would recommend :)",
      "Dr. Fraij's class goes at a fairy slow pace, especially at the beginning of the semester. He makes sure to do a quick recap of the material taught each class and is overall an easy-going professor. There are daily two questions quizzes in class that are easy. The assignments (hw) and exams are fair and cover what you need to know.",
      "Prof Fraij was a good lecturer, although sometimes he doesn't realize the document camera is not showing the papers he is writing on (he doesn't look behind him). Homework and tests are manageable and not too bad. Fraij is passionate about the material and the class is fairly easy if you pay attention. Overall learned a great deal from his class.",
      "The textbook he uses for this class is EXCELLENT! Fraij is a solid lecturer, but make sure to remind him to keep his paper centered when he uses the document camera because he literally never looks behind him :). If you get behind, the book is an excellent substitute for lectures, but you should always go because prof. Fraij is a really great guy.",
      "Fraij was clearly knowledgeable about the course and exhibited great care for his students. Although his lectures are kind of dry, they are informational and tell you everything you need to know. The homework he assigns is very helpful, as the test questions are similar to the homework content, but easier. Overall, he is a wonderful professor.",
      "The material covered in Dr. Fraij's class is somewhat difficult, but he makes a significant effort to keep lectures engaging and help his students succeed in the class. If you pay attention in lecture and do the homeworks, you will do well.",
      "There is an easy quiz every lecture, attending every lecture and paying attention A",
      "Prof's teaching is very effective. Assignment and quizzes are pretty helpful in catching up with the content.",
      "Dr. Fraij explains concepts very well and clearly cares about each student. The tests are manageable and often very similar to homework/discussion problems. My friends in this class have said that Dr. Fraij is extremely friendly and approachable when it comes to asking for help regarding course content.",
      "This class is not challenging. If you pay attention and participate in group work, you will pass. Assignments and tests are not that hard. Dr. Fraij treats his students with respect and seems to enjoy what he is doing.",
      "Fraij is knowledgeable and his class should not be challenging. His cutoff for an A in this class is higher than what you might expect, so be careful.",
      "Really nice professor who really knows the subject well. As long as you pay attention in class, homework and exams are straightforward.",
      "Dr. Fraij is a nice professor. He cares about his students and seems on the top of Discrete Math concepts. The in class work and the discussion sections were very helpful.",
      "Dr. Fraij cares for his students and he cares for his craft. The class wasn't particularly difficult; I'd have made an A if I didn't commute forty miles a day to be there.",
      "Good professor, but as many have said his lectures are not the most engaging. Nonetheless, he is very knowledgeable and will help you if you need it. Do all the work and you will succeed.",
      "All around a good professor. His lectures were incredibly boring and can honestly be completely replaced by reading the textbook and looking at the discussion problem sets. The only thing that kept me going to class was daily quizzes. Otherwise, he explains the concepts well and his tests/assignments were always easy and graded fairly.",
      "Heavy lectures, well prepared lectures, hard assignments, and reasonable tests.",
      "Good professor who cares about his students. The class is not too bad. Homework assigned every week. The homeworks are usually a lot harder than the exam. Quizes every class. He drops lowest 3 quiz grades. Study hard and oay attention in class and you will do fine. His grading scales are by definition curved. To get a C you need a 55.",
      "Fraij is a very nice guy who cares that his students understand the material, but his lectures are very boring. It's hard to pay attention, but he does post all his notes online. Tests are fair, but they are a time crunch. Overall, solid professor, and I learned a lot from his course.",
      "He's a smart guy and a good lecturer. I don't blame him for my lack of understanding of the course material, as it is very tough material. Easily the second toughest course I have taken at UT so far (the first being Operating Systems with Gheith). The assignments are very hard and so are the exams, but the overall grade is given very leniently."

      "If he didn't teach in Lisp and have his unusual love fascination with cons, he might be one of the best professors in UTCS. He's an old timer with unprecedented wit and immense knowledge of CS. His assignments can get difficult, but are very interesting. 1 midterm and final, which are insanely easy since they're multiple choice.",
      "Great guy who really cares about his students and his subjects. There's an attendance grade for lectures, but you really don't need to pay attention in them to do well. I used the lecture time to work on his labs, which do take some time. Tests aren't bad, just go through the book and do the clicker questions in the days beforehand and you're fine.",
      "Expect to spend some time on the labs, they are easy in the beginning but they get quite long at the end. Has 2 tests; a midterm and a final. midterm was very easy, but the final is much harder, still not too bad though. Lots of vocab.",
      "Prof Novak is awesome. He makes the content really interesting and it you pay attention, the class is pretty easy. There are labs every week that you'll likely spend a few hours on. These are not too bad and they tend to be fun. There's one midterm and one final and they were both really easy. The textbook is optional. The class notes are great.",
      "Honestly one of my favorite professors in the CS department! He gives real life examples that make concepts so much easier to understand. Because of this, I feel like I left learning a lot in his class, as well as getting a fair grade. I definitely recommend!",
      "Great class! He has all of the notes available for you and he is very straightforward in explaining everything. Also, he is amazing in responding back to students almost immediately. Only gripe was that he explains everything in lisp and cons, so you kinda have to relearn a bit to be prepared for technical interview.",
      "Novak is a great professor. He gives you all the slides he uses in class and all the homework assignments at the beginning. He is clear and explains well. He is enthusiastic about the material and has some good stories he tells. The tests are very easy, most of the work is for the programming assignments, which are also pretty easy",
      "He's an awesome man. He will offer a new perspective on Data Structure that Mike Scott couldn't do. If you have a question, he will have an answer. You have to ask to get an answer, he WILL NOT babysit you and walk you through everything. You have to work for it. As long as you're willing to try, you will pass the class. Tests are easy, very easy.",
      "Novak is honestly a great professor. He definitely knows the topic extremely well. If you ask him to specify absolutely anything, he will break it down all the way to its core. A lot of profs will say \"just know that it works like this\", but not old Gordy. He is truly a lecturer for the ages. You'll also learn Lisp, which is cool.",
      "Dr. Novak is an excellent professor who is great at \"dumbing things down\" for students. He is hilarious and he knows it too (he laughs at himself frequently). The projects aren't incredibly hard, and he is always willing to help. Extremely approachable. Tests were a piece of cake, just mainly memorizing vocab and posted clicker questions.",
      "Dr. Novak is incredibly funny and has a way of explaining difficult things in simpler terms. That being said, I think I would've learned more in Mike Scott's class. It's annoying that he uses a Lisp-Java interpreter that we won't have to deal with in the real world.",
      "Generally easy class. Lectures are a drag, but he's incredibly helpful on Piazza.",
      "He's a little underrated. Everyone goes for Scott but I have no qualms about Dr. Novak. His lectures are a little dry, but he does inject humor every now and then and the class was a breeze. Some people struggled with the weekly homework, I found it very easy.",
      "His lectures weren't ENTIRELY helpful in terms of learning the necessary material, but were still clear and sometimes funny. He and the TAs are very helpful in that they answer Piazza questions ASAP. HW amount is fair, though be ready to ask questions on Piazza if you get stuck. Takes attendance via iClicker (10% of grade). Overall I recommend.",
      "My only complaint about this course would be the absolute love affair between Dr. Novak and Lisp",
      "Professor Novak has an amazing ability in making super abstract information easy to learn. Also he is the fairest in grading!! The class will have an smooth phase if you start assignments the very first week. His class is great for people who wish to research, and for people who wish to work in the industry.",
      "He is a good professor, and he really cares about the subject that he teaches. The only down side if any is that the projects must be done in recursion which might be upsetting to some. If you want a different perspective take him, if you want a more streamlined class take Scott. I enjoyed Novak's class and made a lot of friends.",
      "Novak is a professor that cares, however he has a poor method of teaching his students. He teaches in Java however all his assignments are written for LISP, and his programs are pre made and messy. I don't recommend him, take Mike Scott instead if possible.",
      "Novak is not a particularly exciting lecturer, but the class is not very difficult. He tends to needless repeat himself which can be annoying. Be sure to do the homework assignments and attend class, and you'll be fine."

      "Solid class. I felt that I learned what I needed to. Also, he was really nice and didn't make the content harder than it needed to be, which I appreciated. Slightly boring lectures at time, but that was more the course than the professor.",
      "The content can be extremely boring for people that want to work at a higher abstraction level, but Bill Young grades leniently and makes the content easy to digest by making all the necessary info available on the slides. As an aside, Bill Young is an amazing person, and if you need support from a professor, he would be a great choice.",
      "Though his lectures are somewhat boring, he explains the material well. Just reading the slides is enough to get a good grade on the exams. The coding assignments are relatively easy, though kinda difficult to start because the instructions aren't clear and he isn't very knowledgeable about them. Stay on top of the material for pop quizzes.",
      "He is a great professor overall. The course is pretty difficult but his grading style makes it easier. Make sure to read the textbook and all his slides before the exams. Labs are basically free 100, as long as you pass all the tests he gives before you turn it in.",
      "Lectures can be a bit dull/confusing but the tests aren't bad if you review the slides well. Pop quizzes can be tough, but they're a small portion of the grade. The first lab (Bit lab) is notoriously difficult, but the rest are manageable. Bill is a very nice and caring guy, and if you're close to a certain grade cutoff, he'll bump up.",
      "The class for our semester was a lot tougher than previous semesters. Young teaches everything that you need on the exams though exams can be rough. The labs in the class are time-consuming and require a lot of work. Pop quizzes are tough if you don't study outside of class. Young is a great lecturer and nice guy, but don't take it in the morning.",
      "Great lecturer who knows his stuff. Bi-weekly labs are a pain in the butt and take a long time, but they really teach you the material. No pop quizzes until the last 2 weeks (which most people bombed both of them). Not a class that requires any participation. Study groups are highly recommended.",
      "Good teacher. Not hard to get an A",
      "Go to class or you will fail. Expect to pay attention during lectures and do lots of reading outside of class. Homeworks are relatively easy. Labs are difficult only if you procrastinate. Tests are straightforward and medium difficulty if you studied. Okay lecturer and someone I don't mind listening to for 2 hours. 10/10.",
      "For those who didn't like his teaching in 429, and thought that he got confused often, don't let that deter you from taking his security class. Security is his passion, and he knows so much about it. He got confused like once or twice, and that was mainly because the student had worded their question weirdly. Projects are fun, and you learn a lot.",
      "Not the easiest class but it could be a lot harder. He does a good job explaining the material and if he can't answer a question that comes up in class, 9 times out of 10 he'll get an answer for it within a week. Really nice and had some great TAs.",
      "Wonderful professor. He's always there to work with his students, and he always wants his kids to do well. Remember, you need to earn the grade in his class so you need to work hard. Start labs early, too!",
      "Bill Young is a caring and approachable professor. Lectures can be pretty boring, but that's probably just the material. He speaks very clearly and answers all questions. You'll have a good idea of what to expect on the tests, as he dedicates a day to ask questions for each one.",
      "Very nice, approachable guy. Lectures are 2 hours long and very dull however. Labs were fun, and while difficult and time consuming they were very rewarding. Only problem is that he didn't understand much outside of what's on his tests. Not a problem if you just want a good grade, but frustrating if you ask anything that's too advanced.",
      "Boring lecturer, and sometimes he gets confused on what he's talking about. Regardless, he's a super nice guy and it's obvious he cares about his students. The material itself is hard, but the textbook is super helpful, so make sure to read it often.",
      "He is the best professor I have ever had. He is interested in student's learning. Labs are supper hard but it it expected in CS! If you put some effort you can do really well in this class and learn a lot for the future. Loved it!",
      "Dr. Young is a boring a dry lecturer, but other than that is a solid professor. Reading out of the textbook is important, but generally tests and assignments are fair.",
      "Loved this class and Dr. Young was really helpful.",
      "Good teacher, very clear. Class was a little too easy and almost a little tedious at times, but that may have just been me.",
      "Nice, friendly guy. The first half of the class is a bit slow, but the later half is interesting. The tests unfortunately require a lot of memorization, but also some thinking. The later projects are interesting and fairly challenging. No book required, which is nice."

      "Dr. Gheith is one of the most amazing professors I've had at UT. His lectures are easy to follow and he manages to make complex subjects very easy to understand. Projects were difficult and time consuming but easily doable if you started early. My only complaint would be that it isn't really possible to study for his tests except by coming to class",
      "Dr. Gheith is probably the best undergraduate professor in UTCS. OS is usually seen as the hardest class of undergrad, but Dr. Gheith's amazing lectures made it a much better experience. He's always available at office hours too. The class is hard but grading is fair and you will come out of it with so much more knowledge than when you went in.",
      "Dr. Gheith's OS is very project based, and you'll know it. Assignments are weekly, and take anywhere from 20 to 60 hours of work. However, he's a great lecturer, is very helpful during office hours, and is easily one of the best professors I've ever had. But with all the late nights in the lab, I never want to take that class again. 10/10.",
      "Gheith is an amazing teacher who knows the material cold (lectures with no notes) and is very nice in office hours. That said, the class is extremely tough, and of the 14 projects, I and most people I know put in 40+ hours of effort on 4 of them. Find a solid group to work with and plan carefully before writing any code, and you will do well",
      "He's an excellent professor, but OS is genuinely one of the hardest classes you can take. It will be really difficult for you. Yes, even you. I'd take it again, but only because of the friends I made in it. I literally lost 15lbs because I was working so much on it. Really. It's 50-60 hrs/week. If you do take it, don't take anything else hard.",
      "Legendary. He's the person who made OS, the most infamous course on the CS degree list, my favorite class at UT. Projects were very time consuming (spent 30+ hours/week) but that's where most of the learning happened. His tests were tough but if you do well on project/quiz it'll be fine. Most importantly he's very approachable so go to office hour!",
      "Gheith was one of the best teachers that I've ever had. He knows his stuff and encourages interesting conversation and lecture. The class is objectively very difficult however. He pushes you hard and enables the student to perform well. As long as you can put in the effort it should be wonderfully challenging.",
      "Gheith is honestly one of the best professors at UT, and has such a different method of teaching. He's really aware if you're not doing well and will do everything he can to make sure you understand the material given you at least put in some effort. I really wish he taught more classes other than Operating Systems",
      "Very, very hard",
      "Absolute best lecturer at UT. He could make a phone book sound exciting, and he explains complicated things really well. But he doesn't expect you to have a life outside his class, and he experiments with the curriculum, often with painful results. Generally 40-60 hours a week on projects. Insane. Exams and weekly quizzes are also pretty tough.",
      "Best lectures I've ever attended. He is an amazing teacher and truly cares that his students understand the material. I took 429H and 439H both with Dr. Gheith. Operating Systems (439H) was a lot of work but I learned so much it was totally worth it! 10/10 my favorite professor and would take any class taught by him.",
      "Amazing lecturer! He's very knowledgable and obviously very passionate about what he teaches. LECTURES ARE BASICALLY MANDATORY because lectures & projects are where the majority of learning is done, and you won't know how to do the projects if you don't go to class. His quizzes and tests are very hard so beware because he doesn't curve.",
      "Amazing teacher!",
      "Helpful professor and knows the material inside & out. However, his CS 429 Summer class was insanely challenging. The assignments and quizzes were brutal. I think half the class ended up dropping.",
      "Professor Gheith actually cares about teaching, and is very good at it. There are projects every week, ranging from fairly easy (3 hrs) to very hard (25hrs). I've taken 3 classes with Gheith so far, and if he taught any more, I'd take them too.",
      "Gheith was hands down the best professor I've had so far. His lectures were clear and he took his time to make sure everyone understood what was going on. The projects were challenging, but nothing not doable. If you get the chance to take this or any other course by him, do it.",
      "Great guy and lecturer. He is one of the nicest professors I've met and truly cares for the students. Class was hard though. Tests were intended to fail you and were far too long for anyone to finish (which he said was his intention.) These tests, however, were curved to compensate. Grading: 40% Projects, 20% Midterm, 20% Final, 20% Quizzes",
      "The best professor I have had at UT. Take any classes that he is offering. Incredibly clear, coherent lecture that goes out of his way to ensure that you actually understand the material. On top of that, he is funny guy that is not a hard ass and understands that grades aren't the be all to life. Tests were open book/notes. Highly recommend"

Ours was godly. Good amount of homework and tests were straightforward. Cheatsheets are allowed on tests. A good counterbalance to Mike's 314.",
      "Bill's lectures can seem slow sometimes, but that's just because he's thorough in his explanation. In my opinion, that's better than a professor breezing through difficult concepts. For the class itself, 10 weekly HWs, no exams or final, 1 semester-long project to build whatever app you want. Easy upperdiv CS class.",
      "Bulko has interesting lectures. He understands the class isn't CS majors so he explains things thoroughly. Exams can be challenging but do-able if you study. Homework assignments every week but are not that hard. He is caring and understanding and is always available during office hours, although you should get there early- lots of students go.",
      "Bulko explains everything at least ten times in class and provides plenty of examples. Go to class, do the homework in the discussion sections and you have an A.",
      "I'm not a CS major (anymore), but I did think he was a good professor. The class was very difficult, but I think he was somewhat of an easy grader (relative to how crappy a student I was).",
      "IThis class is really boring but Bulko knows that and tries to keep the lectures semi-interesting, but still if you're not careful you'll fall asleep. The TA's were not very helpful but if you form a study group for the homework you should get good grades. Make a good cheatsheet for the test and you'll be solid, they're not as hard as the hw.",
      "A really easy course, he allows cheat sheet in the tests and that is really helpful.",
      "Great class and great professor.",
      "He lets you bring a cheat sheet on the test, which is great. The tests should be easy if you put the right things on your cheat sheets, unless you're great at memorization. Homework is helpful in preparing you from exams. Good guy.",
      "I found Bulko's CS311 class easy and manageable in terms of concept and workload, and a good counterpart to Mike Scott's difficult CS 314 class. His lectures are understanding and entertaining (enhanced by his amusing/dry jokes (depending on the person)). HW can be unnecessarily difficult, but tests are a lot easier. Just watch out for your TA.",
      "Sometimes he wasn't prepared, and because the course is a boring topic to many, it was really hard to focus during class. There's one assignment per week. The TAs were my favorite part of the class. He mentions things in class that are essential to the exam. They take time to grade to give proper feedback. Some tests were more difficult than others",
      "Dr. Bulko is an incredibly reasonable professor. He doesn't ask you to buy the textbook because he understands that college kids already have to pay for so much! He also gets that Discrete Math isn't the most exciting topic, so he jokes and does his best to keep lecures entertaining, which I really appreciated. All in all he's a great, caring prof!",
      "Bulko's class was pretty easy, and for the most part he was engaging in his lectures. Sometimes the lectures felt a little drawn out, but I think that's just due to the topics we went over. Be sure not to forget to turn in a homework, homework was about 40% of the grade, so if you do them the class should be a pretty easy A since tests were easy.",
      "An amusing professor who will try to engage the class. Very nice and tries to explain further if needed. Work was doable for slackers and slow people like me.",
      "great professor who makes discrete math easy. if you need help then just go to his office hours, he's super helpful and tries to remember your name if you go.",
      "He's a very sweet and logical professor in that he won't make you do unreasonable work. Weekly homeworks are worth a portion of your average but are super easy, so be sure to keep up with them. Provides most information in lecture so studying isn't hard or long at all. Tests are easy and he provides help if needed. Would definitely take him again!",
      "Prof. Bulko is an amazing human being but can be a bit confusing while explaining stuff. The exams and hw were super easy and he helps out a lot if you go to his office hours. The class was a bit unorganized in my opinion and could be improved upon. He does make the occasional joke to keep the class interesting though. Take if you want an easy A."

      "People keep saying that Norman has favorites, but this is so far from the truth. I've noticed that students who do poorly on tests generally attribute this to her &quot;not liking them&quot;. Her grading scheme is very arbitrary on tests but it is still fair since it is applied to everyone. Overall solid professor with a difficult but rewarding class.",
      "Dr. Norman adds an emotional dimension to the course material that you would not find from other professors - both from her lectures and from the suffering in the infamous Pintos projects. Watch out for Project 3 - many groups take between 60 to 100 logged programming hours to complete it! If you like working alone, consider taking Gheith.",
      "Dr. Norman is a good lecturer. She is very passionate about what she does. The class itself is very time consuming, but you do learn a lot. The tests, even though she insists are not about memorization, involve a lot of buzzwords that you need to hit to get credit, so memorizing will serve you well, even if you understand the material already.",
      "Exams are somewhat arbitrary and mostly PowerPoint slide regurgitation, though she insists otherwise. Projects are time consuming. Make sure to choose a solid group.",
      "By far the most difficult class I've ever taken. Everything your hear about 439 is true and not exaggerated. You'll spend dozens of hours in the lab almost every week, but the material you're learning is important. She grades harsh, but if you're actually making a strong effort you'll pass. Overall a great professor.",
      "Its the class youve been afraid of. Norman is an AMAZING professor though and this has been my favorite (and hardest) class. As are possible if you actually do the readings, take good notes, and select a good team for the projects. Take easy gen eds with it. Dont cheat or google for past projects - shell find out and you will fail.",
      "The class is VERY time consuming. The exams are hard, class average for the first exam was in the 60s. Everyone knows this class is hard but she curves at the end and homework and attendance boosts your grade. She is the most experienced 439 professor and does everything possible to help students succeed, take her but get ready to work",
      "This class is /hard/. Definitely. But Norman has a lot of experience teaching it, cares deeply about her students, and has structured the class to allow for a ton of help for students. The projects are long and difficult, but the lectures and tests are very closely connected- study the notes and you'll do well on the test. Projects are groups 2-4.",
      "Dr. Norman is an excellent lecturer, but the class is difficult. Projects are very long and feedback on the projects is extremely slow (like 1.5 months slow). The content is also difficult. The class is doable, but get ready to work.",
      "Norman is super nice and a great lecturer. She always asks if anyone has any questions at every opportunity. The reason the class is so difficult is 1) There is A LOT of material you have to know 2) The projects are LONG. 40 hours a week long. My only critique is her tests are garbage. Reviewing past tests is A MUST to understand grading criteria.",
      "The projects are difficult, but manageable, and there are almost daily lab hours with the TAs to help with. The test were somewhat hard, but she gave a reasonable curve at the end. The projects were meaningful and the class was very informative. In short, yes the class is hard but you'll learn at lot and be a better coder because of it.",
      "Ok yes. The projects are hard. She knows they are hard. However, classes like these are the ones that truly make you a better programmer. And I have to say that the tests were relatively easy and are most of your grade. So just try your best on the projects, and don't fret. Dr. Norman is very helpful, respectful, and self-aware of her class.",
      "Alison's lectures using PowerPoint. She is good at lecturing and you always leave learning something. Her exams were rough but she does curve the class when the grades are bad. The projects for the class are very demanding but you will learn a lot after doing them. Her office hours are helpful."

      "The professor seemed like a pretty good teacher, but I don't think computer architecture is his forte. It seemed at times that the TA was more knowledgeable about the course, although he is also very intelligent. Homework seemed worth too little credit, but they were still helpful. He tried pretty hard to be helpful as much as possible",

      "Very good professor, willing to help. Difficult class regardless of who is teaching it. Tests can be very tricky. Sometimes it felt like it was more of a test over how little mistakes you can make under pressure rather than a test of your knowledge on the subject. UT CS students can be incredibly condescending, have a thick skin and ask questions.",
      "Was super involved with the students, held lots of office hours, and allowed students to come in after exams to discussdebate the answers to the more difficult questions. Overall, a good professor; however, he can be forgetful or just plain wrong often during lectures and has to rely on his TA to catch mistakes.",

      "Elaine is the sweetest woman. I took here UGS with Alan (her husband) and they were tough, but great. The class was challenging, but you learn a lot and the really care about you as a person. In the end they did a lot of rounding to help students out as long as you were trying. If you went to office hours they'd answer anything. Great class!",
      "Ok so I took this class during 1st year. The prof was very caring and nice, but if I look back now I just can't believe how difficult the course was. 301k was a lower division elective that DOES NOT count towards your degree, but there was so much readings in every module and tests that now makes me feel as if it was a mandatory upper-div class.",
      "There's a decent amount of work in her Foundations of Logic course, but the grading is fairly lenient, so it's possible to make a decent number of mistakes and still get a good grade. Good at explaining things, though the nature of the course is a bit abstract so it might not stick with everyone.",
      "The class itself was great. She taught it in tandem with her husband Alan Cline, and together they're just hilarious. The course itself however was... meh. I took it when they had just finished building a new means of teaching the course (I.E. guinea pig), but I had a pretty hard time with it. She curved though and I ended up with an okay grade.",
      "One of the best teachers. People said she was difficult but really if you just pay attention and read the books you'll do fine. Don't wait till the last minute to do the programming projects/homework. The only difficult things are her tests but she gives a generous curve. Don't skip class, tests are based mainly on in class lectures.",
      "Great professor. Rich's undergrad studies class is very educational, but not an inordinate amount of work. Lectures/discussions are interesting and engaging. Not a blow-off class, but not more than a few hours of work a week (on average).",
      "I LOVE Dr. Rich! She is so helpful and understanding. She makes you work hard, but she want to motivate her students rather than harm their grades. I definitely recommend CS 302 with her!",
      "She makes you work hard, but it's all worth it in the end.",
      "AWESOME professor! The course is really hard, but you really hone your critical thinking skills, and you uncover how to do stuff like prove what a computer cannot do. A lot of people come back to praise how useful it is after graduation, and you get a good feel of the theory on which computing is predicated.",
      "Automata Theory with Rich is hard... but you learn the most compared to the other professors. Besides, only about 4 of the proofs are really hard."

      "one of the most caring people i have met. he truly cares if his students learn the material and is extremely accessible outof class. as an english major i took this class for the science credit. i constantly went to his office hours and he was more than happy to go through homework, assignments and exams with me. strongly recommend",
      "Dr. Porter was such an inspiring professor, he truly cares about all students regardless if you're very involved or not. Really knowledgeable and has ton of experience that is super cool to learn from. Honestly one of the best professors at UT.",
      "this professor was great. he was one of my favorite at UT. he made me really understand and enjoy CS when i never saw myself doing that. so accessible outside of class. if you want an A you need to work for it but he will help you every step of the way. he will always be there to answer questions and makes you feel comfortable .",
      "Dr. Porter is very understanding and very respectable. The class goes over lots of interesting topics. It's not hard, just a lot of work. The tests are based on the homeworks and in class assignments so if you do those you should be good. You have to do well on the tests to do well in the class. I'm on the line for an A or A-.",
      "I suggest having some knowledge of CS before taking the class. This class is an overview of different aspects within CS, so we go over programming, implications of AI, and upcoming developments. It moves too fast for someone like me who isn't familiar with the subject. But Bruce is a really wonderful and smart guy. Tests are exactly like homework.",
      "This guy is the nicest professor out there. He's smart and he really cares about the learning and progress of students. His class covers very basic intro to coding (java) and computers. The exams come straight from the homework so do the labs. Would definitely recommend this class.",
      "I'm about to begin my Junior year and this by far has been my easiest class in UT so far. I just needed another science requirement so i decided to take this class. You learn basic Java stuff and binary which is cool. Really nice guy kind of interesting, but easy course. The final was a joke, basically review sheet.",
      "He seems intimidating at first, because of his age, and his talk about his experience teaching. He is very clear, offers help in every way possible, and truly cares about conveying the information to you in an understandable manner. For someone with no computer science background, he is a great professor!",
      "One of the best professors I've had. The second day of class it becomes obvious he cares about learning, not just memorization. The tests are taken directly from the homeworks, so if you put the effort into understanding what's going on you can get an A. You'll learn a ton of cool stuff, and he makes it easy"

      "Professor Papa is amazing. His lectures are on the applied side, which is expected for a class like this, but they are pretty interesting. Projects are incredibly time-consuming, but really satisfying when you finish and cover a lot of different things that are industry-applicable. If you have room in your schedule, definitely take his course!",
      "This is a great class and a must have for anyone looking for a job in web tech. I wish there was more time to finish the last project. I spent long nights :-( but on the other hand I learned a lot. You need to be a google search master as you will need it. Highly recommended.",
      "Prof. Papa is tre be prof and CS dept. very useful material to get a job in web tech. I was hired by Amazon just on my projects in this class. A former student on the class was my interviewer. Thanks prof Papa.",
      "This class is amazing. Do not believe the bad reviews, They are from students that likely scored badly in the exams an exercises. This class is TOUGH! The exercises are TOUGH. This class is not for you unless you want to spend LOTS of hours at the end of the course. For me, I was able to use homework 8 in my portfolio to get an internship.",
      "I agree with the comment &quot;Be ready to self-study. The assignments requires HARD WORK.&quot; It is totally true, BUT what you get out of the assignment is ready material for your portfolio to show recruiters and for internships interviews. I just showed my project and got the internship with barely extra effort. Can't say that for any other CS course.",
      "Be ready to self-study. The assignments requires HARD WORK.",
      "Prof. Papa is the best way to get jobs in webtech at USC. Period. This class is really the only avenue for that for both Internships and PERM jobs. I got my summer internship because of the CSCI571 projects and I have not even finished the course. Must take course.",
      "Heading towards the end of our course. I would like to thank Papa for the tremendous knowledge he helped me gain with CSCI 571. It helped me bag an internship with amazing pay and perks in Bay Area. Yes, the homeworks are heavy and it can be frustrating when you have assignments of multiple subjects piled up, but I guess it is worth our efforts.",
      "This class is awesome! Prof. Papa is very inspirational. One of the best CA classes at USC.",
      "Prof. Papa manages a hard class. That is why some people find it too difficult and complain. BUT I got an internship at Google's YouTube just because of what Prof. Papa taught me. If you want a job in Webtech, this si the class to take. Highly recommended.",
      "Just landed an internship at Quora. All because of this class. The last 2 homework exercises were really tough and time consuming, but I learned so much that the interviews in webtech were just a piece of cake. Do not take this class if you are not ready to spend long nights the last 4 weeks of the course. You've been warned. Best Prof. at USC.",
      "Great lecture and material, but be warned. The last two exercises are MASSIVE in terms of amount of time needed. I spent weeks of night programming to get then done. But the tradeoff, I gained huge knowledge. A hard class but very valuable for all web tech aficionados.",
      "Great class material. Prof has lots of industry experience. Love the stuff about React, Firebase and TOR. Highly recommended for anyone interested in Webtech.",
      "Prof. Papa is teaching one of the best classes at USC. And now that he only teaches one section, it is very tough to get in. The reason is that students that take this class have an easier time finding jobs in Webtech. I just landed a position at Amazon, and all because of this class. Thanks Prof. Papa. This is a must class for anyone in CS.",
      "Best class I took at USC for my next job: webtech. Prof. is really good an industry-savvy. Helps a lot with internship applications. BUT, this class is tough. Lots of homework, long nights. But is was all worth it.",
      "This is not an easy class. I understand a few student got F for collaborating because of the amount of time needed for the exercises. I personally think it is true. BUT, the results for me are amazing. Got through my internships interviews incredibly well, all because of the material I learned here. Prof. Papa is helping students. And he is funny!",
      "One of the best courses in the CS dept, and the only one that covers in depth Webtech. Don't get me wrong, this is a tough course, and the competition for good grades is fierce with 400+ students, but the material is awesome and prof Papa is a great presenter. It shows that he is an expert in the subject. Highly recommended to s/w developers.",
      "Hot class! Great material! Fabulous prof. 'Nuff said!",
      "Super important material for jobs in Web tech. Great prof. super accessible on Piazza. a must class for any CS Master graduate.",
      "Fabulous course and professor. Already used material for getting an internship. Prof has huge industry background. A must for cs students interested in webtech.",
      "This class is tough, but awesome for anyone in Webtech. Everything included: HTML5, CSS3, lots of JavaScript, NodeJS, Bootstrap, React, Firebase, AWS and Google cloud, ioS and Android client dev. The homeworks are very difficult and take lots of work, BUT there is no other course at USC better than this on WebTech. The prof is amazing!",
      "Lots of difficult but inspiring homework. A must if you want to get a job in WebTech. Prof. Papa is as good as it gets. Highly recommended for client and server webtech.",
      "Just to reiterate I think this is the best course I am taking at USC. The material is going to be a huge help in finding a job in Webtech. I'm looking forward to lectures on serverless, microservices, AWS Lambda, React and Firebase. Prof. Papa is always very prepared and a huge help on Piazza. He is a great instructor. Funny, too.",
      "CSCI571 is really awesome! I got to learn much in this class, the professor is caring, producers are really knowledgeable, I am an EE student but I learned about about web technologies. The HWs are really amazing, MAKE SURE TO DO THE HW ASAP., though the graders are not so mean about grades.",
      "Wow, this class was awesome! But it was very hard. Just finished the last mobile project. Got 10/10 but it cost me two weeks of late nights. The class material is very good. Prof. Papa is very inspiring and shows you the latest wbtech. I was able to see going to the Dark Web. For anyone interested in webtech this course is must. Its worth it.",
      "I am almost done with the Fall semester of CSCI6571 and this class is awesome, but very, very heavy on homeworks, that get progressively more difficult and time consuming. But it is all for good as you will get some fabulous material. We just covered, AWS and GCP cloud, plus serverless AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions. Fascinating!",
      "Great home works on Wb App and mobile app. Super fast responses on Piazza. Loved the server less like AWSLambda. Prof told half the students get A or A minus. I did. LOL.",
      "Great class. Great Prof. Worth the LOTS of money I paid for it (4 units at USC are expensive).",
      "This class got me an internship at Amazon! I had everything to nail the interview: nodejs, pHP, angular and most of all AWS. the prof. Is always online day and night on Piazza. My doubt were solved in minutes. The exercises are HARD. Don't take this class if you do not have time. I spent many nights working on the web app and mobile app. Take this.",
      "Great course.",
      "It was a different experience and I got to learn a lot",
      "Great Prof. I'm glad I have only a final. The final projects were HARD! Good solving my doubts on Piazza. Prof. helped finding internship in web tech. Recommended.",
      "Very Professional and curt, but has a good sense of humor once you get to know him. Good knowledge and is a SME in the field. Tough yet challenging assignments, makes you work hard even through exams. But you will come out of class with a lot of skills and learning!",
      "Prof. Papa's CS571 is easily one of the best courses for Computer Science Master's Student out there at USC. Assignments will really help you get your feet wet in all the current web technologies. You will have to really work hard for your grades but it's worth it at the end of the day! Recommend this class to anyone planning on MS in CS at USC.",
      "Professor Papa is really good. He kept the materials up-to-date and illustrated each topic very clearly. The homework is not so difficult. Finishing them independently will give you solid foundation of web technology.",
      "Lots of learning. You will not regret taking this course. The assignments are designed to get your hands on a lot of concepts which are currently being used in industry which ultimately adds a lot of value to resume.",
      "He is very good",
      "Course is harder than I thought. Prof has lots of industry experience. Piazza is used 100% for solving my doubts. Glad Papa is flexible to change and dump the videos (really boring) and replace with hands-on demos. Exams require some memorization and lots of JavaScript knowledge. But I am glad I took it. Requirement for CSCI572.",
      "Prof. is good. Listens to students: dropped the crappy videos and started doing demos, which solved all my s/w installation doubts. would recommend. It's hard, though.",
      "Prof. Papa is a bit rough at times, but the material is very topical. I just went through \"serverless architectures\" like AWS Lambda and Google Functions and I knew that will help me get an internship at Amazon this summer. Exams are a bit rough with a lot of code, but the exercises are the bulk of the grade. Papa solved all my doubts on Piazza.",
      "One month to go in this course, and I am glad I signed up. Great material. I disliked the slides, though. I am glad Prof. Papa switched to hands-on demos. Much better. Also glad no more switching on spec online. Glad the prof is listening to students complaints. That's refreshing. I will take CSCI572, as definitely I have all needed background.",
      "Prof. Papa provides great new material. Just saw stuff on AWS Lambda and Google Functions, the server less stuff. It is going to help together me a job in web tech easier. Prof. is online on Piazza at all hours, day and night. Weird but great. I recommend for everyone interested in web tech. The class is not easy, though.",
      "Prof. Papa is very knowledgeable about Webtech and resolves all my doubts on Piazza or in class. I am at middle of the course, I would take it for sure, I recommend.",
      "This class was not easy. Professor Papa is a great Prof. Responds to all doubts really quickly on Piazza. He is funny in class. Good lectures. The exams are OK, but the last two exercises required LOTS of work, but I was proud the the finished products! A must for students interested in Webtech.",
      "Glad I took Prof. Papa class, as I want to get a job in Webtech. Waiting for my Final, I know I will get an A. Class was medium difficulty for me. Material will help me in getting an internship at Amazon, as it includes lectures and homeworks on AWS and cloud platforms like NodeJS. Thanks, Prof. Midterm was easy for me. The Android app was hard.",
      "Fabulous Prof. Very knowledgeable of the industry. Material is very good: NodeJS, AWS, Google Cloud platform, Bootstrap, jQuery, HTML5, Angular, and I did my mobile project on my iPhone. That will get me ready for my interviews with Google and Ebay. Prof answered all my doubts on Piazza, really quickly. Thanks, prof!",
      "Awesome class. Heavy on exercises, especially the last 2. Appreciate all the Javascript stuff, especially Node and Angular. Will help me with getting an internship next spring. Prof. Papa is hilarious, even with a class that is so frigging quiet. Highly recommended for students wanting a leg on on interviews.",
      "Great class. Great Prof. Papa. Material that I will keep. I'm trying to get a position as Grader for next semester. Will work for hard on the mobile app.",
      "Great class. Great prof. Exactly the stuff I need for my planned job. The last exercises are frigging tough but 'no pain no gain.' The students that complain about the mobile exercise toughness are losers. Who told you this was easy? Grow up! Thanks prof. Papa for a wonderful class.",
      "Unlike the student that posted 3 times (LOL) complaining about getting no help about Mobile, the homework specs are awesome, and the additional Hints and Clues files are plenty of help. I heard that this class has become harder but much better in material over the years. I really appreciated it covered tons of JS libraries. I'm glad I took it.",
      "Wasn't interested int the subject until this class. Now I'll go for a job in Webtech. Or maybe mobile computing. Thanks, Prof.",
      "Good lecture material. Prof. papa has a lot of industry experience and it shows in his lectures. Last mobile app was difficult, took me 3 week to finish completely. But I am happy I did it. Recommnded.",
      "Great Prof. Class is awesome! Took it in Fall 2015. Helped me get an internship at eBay this summer. If you are into webtech, it is a must take class.",
      "I like Prof. Papa and knowledge of the industry. I am now at Amazon on an internship and I got it all because of this class and a recommendation from the prof. The last 2 exercises are tough but they gave me the needed background for winning the intern.",
      "I like the material, useful for anyone interested in webtech. Prof is good, seems to have a lot of work experience on it. I had a few doubts and he answered on Piazza pretty mush right away. I recommend.",
      "I like Prof. Papa teaching. I learned about a lot of new tech like Nodes DOT js, cloud computing, Angular DOT js. But the most helpful was the mobile device project, tough but rewarding.",
      "He's so cool . Great stuff that will has helped me land a summer internship at Amazon.",
      "Excellent professor! Totally worth taking a class under him. Web tech is mandatory for a good job these days. Prof will give you all is needed.",
      "On of the best professors I have had at USC.",
      "This was a great experience. If you do not have good programming experience, you should NOT take this class. It is now very heavvy on programing, especially the last two assignment/ Professor puts together great projects. Lectures are good.",
      "Great professor.",
      "Pretty good instructor. Moves through the material VERY fast. Is a little awkward, but his jokes are funny at times like \"Silicon Valley\". Seems to really love teaching at USC. Class was hard for me, but not for others. Half the students get A and A-. I didn't get the best grade but I deserved it.",
      "Prof. Papa is a great teacher. He explains everything clearly. The class was a very good learning experience, very worthwhile. He clears all the doubts in Piazza within 5-10 minutes. I recommend this class.",
      "Professor Papa is one of the best professors at USC. He is always responsive and he is online on Piazza at any time of the day or night if you need help. CSCI 571 was an amazing class, especially if you are new to Web technologies. It was well-organized, interesting, and the lectures were great.",
      "Very hard, but good class. Last two exercises will take a long time. Prof is on Piazza all the time, it is funny. Got answered at 3AM.",
      "Very good professor. Tough homeworks. Highly recommended.",
      "This course made me learn a lot. It also gave me an hon-campus job in USC Housing and an internship at a local startup. Even the guest lectures helped as I was not familiar with Agile and Scrum and the company I am interning uses Scrum. Lectures are inspirational. Great stuff about jQuery, NodeJS, JSON, an mobile development. Exams are hard.",
      "I really learned a lot from this class. The last 2 homeworks are hard but rewarding, pushing me to learn new stuff. The class content is abundant and can easily relate to everyday life. Moreover, it's a practical course that I can apply immediately into industry. This summer I'll be interning at Expedia and I'm sure this class gives me a good start",
      "Love this prof. Material is very topical, especially the Cloud stuff, mobile development and new tech like Note JS. I wish more projects like the last 2. The earlier were too easy. Exams had a bit too much memorization, though. Prof is available on Piazza anytime.",
      "Prof. Papa makes this a hard class, especially the exercises that seem to become more and more difficult every semester, but the upside is that they are real examples of web apps and native mobile apps. I became a grader and then a Producer for the class and all that landed me a job at Amazon. Could not have do it without the help of Prof. Papa.",
      "Took the Course in the Spring 2015. The real value of the course is the fact that it prepared me for my Internship at Amazon and a subsequent OPT offer also at Amazon. Prof. Papa game me all the tools to beat many other student competing with me for those positions. This is a tough but great course. The memorization issue actually helped me.",
      "Just started the course and I am enjoying it very much. Prof. Papa always brings up historical tidbits about the Web that really put its development into perspective. I am really looking forward to doing an Ebay Web app and iOS app. I am also excited at the prospect of learning howe to use AWS. Lectures are long at times, though.",
      "Papa is one of the worst professor you will come across at USC. He has lot of attitude and is very abrasive. He makes fun when someone asks a silly question. Not at all fit to be a professor. However, the course is good if you are looking to add various skills to your resume.. Exam is all memory based. You have to mug up a lot.",
      "Although I have to say that Professor Papa is not that good at lecturing, but the the material covered in the lecture, oh no, ppt is fantastic! Almost cover everything important. I also love the assignment, which is clearly organized and useful for learning web developing. The only problem is the exam. You have to recite a lot from PPT.",
      "This course just winded down. Material was consistently updated. Prof. Papa gives feedback and student help using Piazza and it works: my questions were answered in a matter of minutes. I enjoyed the lectures on Bootsrap, JQuery and HTML5. These are going to help me when I look for a webtech job. I would love more live demos and more code samples.",
      "I am almost done with this class for Fall 2014, and it is getting progressively difficult. I have appreciated Prof. Papa additions of JQuery, Bootstrap and al the help he is giving us on the Android development (a new for me). Prof. Papa makes good use of the additional screen in SAL 101, with lots of demos for the code. Very good instructor.",
      "I'm in the middle of an internship obtained because of the material covered in Dr. Papa class. I know now that the class prepared me perfectly for the internship (lots of JavaScript, HTML5, Android API). Dr. Papa definitely nailed the material I needed to know. Exams were not easy and the mobile demo took lots of time, but it paid off for me.",
      "Just got my grade, A. Not an easy class, especially since the last exercises are pretty involved. Prof. Papa brings what seems a lot of industry experience and the lecture are always interesting as he makes use of multiple screens with all his iPads and MacBook. I was a able to get an internships real easily given the background I acquired.",
      "Just finished the Spring course. It was *not* easy! The last project was really complex, but I am glad I was able to finish it. The whole course was pretty intense, but having gotten through I came out with a lot of info that I can use in my job search in web tech. Prof. Papa has presented relevant material that already helped me get an internship.",
      "Excellent course and instructor. I am taking this class in my second semester at USC and I love the material. Prof. Papa is very good at showing us all web technologies and the history behind them. He is also very active on Piazza which makes it very easy to get doubts answered quickly. I think I will get get prepared to interview for web tech.",
      "Outstanding course. I ended up in the top 5%, and it was not easy, but the material is oustanding, and Prof. Papa knowledge of the industry is huge. I ended upbeing offered a DR, which is great. Highly recommended for masters students.",
      "I am through about 1/2 half of the course (we are having the midterm this week) and this course has been outstanding. The extra visual presentation, using multiple screens with macbook and iPads, in GFS 106 is probably helping, but the material is well constructed and I really appreciate Prof. Papa knowledge of the technology space.",
      "Just started taking this class. Earlier lectures are really cool. Also the classroom is amazing and Prof. Papa is using all the screens for a very good audio/video presentation. I am really looking forward to attend the rest of the course.",
      "I attended Papa's class in 2008 and his class is my favorite. The assignments are very well organized, and I was always impressed by his passion for new technology. Though the class is most about web tech, Papa also introduced the mobile development and it totally changed my life! As a senior mobile engineer, I really appreciate his help!",
      "Attending this class gave me access to an internship at Google. There is no book required, all the slides are available online, though I decided to attend the lectures so I could ask questions. Last semester we were able to do AWS and mobile project and it was awesome. Prof. Papa is a great instructor.",
      "thanks to the awesome guidance provided by Professor Papa this course broadened my skill set and gave me exposure to multiple web technologies also increased my interest in building web products. I would highly recommend this course under professor papa to everyone.",
      "Prof Papa is decent for graduate level. People who come in the class expecting to have their hand held will likely struggle. Going to class is not necessary because he simply reads off the slides, but when you ask well-formed questions online (Piazza) he'll respond (he says he doesn't reply to emails). Work is interesting assignments that are easy."

      "Professor Cheng is a solid choice. The class is full of concepts but he explains everything fairly well. He's very helpful with the assignments, especially debugging. All materials are online and grading criteria are extra clear. The cons: sometimes talks too quickly, and assignments are time-consuming. A good cheat sheet will save you in exams.",
      "Expectations were pretty high, and the course delivers! Probably one of the most useful courses. OS dev won't seem like alchemy anymore. If you want to tackle the harder challenges in assignments, it would be wise to use a separate branch since final assignments will tie everything together, so you want everything to be correct. Have fun!",
      "The best professor at USC without doubt, his class is the best organized class you will find Explains the stuff pretty well.",
      "Literally one of, if not the best(and toughest) course and Prof in USC CS",
      "One of the best Prof in USC. You dont want to miss his class",
      "Heavy project work cool examinations (MCQ) type . One of the best professors in USC.",
      "One of the best professor I've met in Viterbi. He is so familiar with everything about OS. His lectures are compact, fast-paced and smooth. He also spent a lot of time to answer all of the students' questions in Google groups that I have to unsubscribe the email notification from that group.",
      "Definitely a tough course, exams are difficult and requires really thorough understanding of materials. Every coding HW is a struggle for me, but I managed through and learned a lot. Lecturing is a bit dull (but informative). Mandatory attendance is a minus. Definitely recommend this course to those who want to challenge themselves.",
      "I learned my operating system concepts under him. A lot of hands on project and assignments. Really enjoyed working on my final OS project",
      "He is a great lecturer, but makes you work hard",
      "He is one of the best professor ever at USC. He teaches really well. Everything is so organized in his class. I wish he taught other subjects too.",
      "I totally recommend this course for CS students in USC. It is worth taking this course. Professor is so clear in his course material and fair to everyone. He is fair to each and every student in class. Coursework is designed such that you will understand many how and why questions related to OS and computer itself. I totally enjoyed the course.",
      "Lectures are very delineated and often even corrects the textbook.",
      "Great Professor. Really teaches the concepts very well. I took CS-402 under him. His projects, although repetitive, are very useful and if you work hard towards them they will be very useful, both for other classes and for interviews. He gives a lot of extra credit so getting anything less than a B+ in his class is not possible.",
      "Thorough rule, very caring, answers from Google Group is fast and juicy no matter how trivial the problem is, great prof!!!",
      "CS 402. This course under him is one of the best options for USC CS students. Assignments and lectures are good.",
      "Overall, an excellent class. If you put in the effort you'll learn more than you've ever learned before. Having said that, be prepared to work more than you've ever worked. On busy days, I was working 10-14 hours per day. Unless you take it during summer, your other course better be easy.",
      "Great teaching, amazing assignments but a tough course",
      "Class was done very well. Lectures were very well prepared and clear. The group projects were hard but made me understand how OS's work. The last project is extremely hard. Overall a fantastic class. It has made me a better software engineer.",
      "He has his own way of teaching, lectures are informative, assignments are challenging, tests are tricky. I would like to take another course under him. He is inspirational to many.",
      "Prof is very clear with what he is teaching. Grading guidelines are damn clear. Assignments, syllabus , exams everything is pre-decided and transparent. CS402 course is hard but made it simple by prof.",
      "Great learning experience",
      "Good Professor. Lengthy lectures and long assignments but clears your concepts. Helps you learn a lot.",
      "Good course although assignments are very time consuming.",
      "Great prof. Hard course though.",
      "Well organized, very useful class",
      "Professor is a stickler for rules. Stick to them, and it will hold you in good stead. Clear grading criteria. Exams are decently tough, everything is conceptual based. Kernel assignments 1 and 2 are pretty easy; if you wish to complete kernel 3, you will need a good team and a lot of time.",
      "Excellent kernel assignments, makes you understand the material better. Be sure to attend lectures to get extra credit. Extremely helpful. Be sure to follow his rules!",
      "Class is good. Kernel assignments 1 and 2 are not that difficult, they can be done in 1-2 weeks. However, kernel assignment 3 takes at least a month to get the whole thing working. Exam questions come straight from the slides, but you gotta understand the concepts clearly cause questions are tricky. His explanations of slides are good but boring.",
      "Awesom Prof. Teaching is not that great but the assignments make you work your ass out, you will in turn learn A LOT. Exams are not so hard. Grading is pretty good and fair. If you get a chance to take cs402 under him, JUST TAKE IT",
      "teaching is good. All assignments are good except the last kernel which is not necessary unless you specialize in systems.",
      "useful class",
      "Assignments help learn a lot. Lectures are good.",
      "very very complex assignments. Some assignments seems worthless . Lecture are quite boring and monotonous. But professor's explanations of topics are good.",
      "Professor Cheng did a great job to teach this course!",
      "Overall a good professor.",
      "Good Professor but assignment guidelines are a bit difficult to follow .",
      "useful for students who want to transfer to cs",
      "Excellent Professor. Very well organized projects and assignments. Encourages discussion among students through google groups. Easily approachable and ready to help. His exams are purely based on slides and its pretty score good grades in exams. OS under Cheng is worth the course!",
      "A very dedicated professor and explains very well. Supports students to a large extent and is very encouraging. Learned a lot from this course. The Professor puts in lots of attention and effort, which is evident in the slides which have step by step code flow.",
      "The kernel assignments are not easy but we all know OS is not easy, right? Anyway, Bill gives a good grade for students who really follow his schedule.",
      "Good points: 1. good coursework and great assignments! 2. Always helpful with the assignments as they do need discussion to solve. 3. Explains points clearly. Areas that need improvement: Exam pattern 2. Prof needs to draw attention from students",
      "Assignments are really good and can learn a lot from assignments. It helped me during my internship interviews and also honed my programing skills. Course is very well structured :)",
      "Recommend this course with Prof. Cheng. Extremely important course. Bill explains the things clearly. Project is really fun. The only downside I experienced was the exams. Midterm and final are silly as it was like reciting the slides",
      "Good Professor and great clarity. Good projects and with good approach.",
      "PROFESSOR CHENG IS REALLY GOOD AND PAY GREAT ATTENTION TO DETAILS.",
      "Projects are great for Resume. Lectures get a bit monotonous- could be made interactive. Overall a good course and beneficial for getting internships.",
      "The course structure is very good and assignments are very helpful. But, Prof. Cheng needs to make lectures more interesting and interactive. I found lectures monotonous.",
      "Good projects.",
      "Recommend this Proff !",

      "Good Professor!",
      "He is a kind professor",
      "Good Professor",
      "This is the only course I took on kernel and it is very helpful. The lecturer clearly explains every points.",
      "This is a very helpful course. And Bill taught very well!",
      "He is nice professor but you need to be catchy in the class to understand the stuff .. Tip is read the topic before attending the class and attend all the classes at higher priority helps to clarify the doubts, very helpful and very clear with programming concepts",
      "he gets you ready for any os interview, you'll learn a lot",
      "If you want to crack any interview related to OS, this course is the key.",
      "The concept and the material on class is not that hard but the project is not that easy.",
      "The course is very valuable in terms of its project, and do a big amount of favor if you can memorize things on lecture notes. The thing is, the concept of operating system is a kind of nested, if you cannot review the lecture on den, you will definitely fall behind.",
      "Excellent course work and projects. The concepts are very interesting and are discussed as much as it is necessary. Since the course domain is very vast don't expect spoon feeding.",
      "Very helpful professor and gives good coding assignments which will help you a lot",
      "Great professor and his teaching is excellent. You have to be really concentrating in this class, otherwise you will be lost. If you sit and listen to his class properly, I am sure you will know how good he is. He is also very helpful during office hours.",
      "I like this Professor and the course he taught! I'm not a CS student but still can catch Cheng's class which is really important to me!",
      "The lectures are not so bad as some other people comment. Algorithm is a difficult course, and if you don't do some pre-course reading, you will get lost during the lecture. Most importantly, his lecture slides are full of key points and examples. This is good if you want to review the course material after a long time.",
      "very clear and would go back and explain whenever asked",
      "Overall it's pretty good.",
      "Nice professor.",
      "very interesting class!",
      "He made operating systems very easy to comprehend..",
      "Solid professor, can't go wrong with this one. Lectures are pretty straight forward, homeworks assigned are pretty interesting. He is very organized but also strict with his grading policies. Very friendly in office hours.",
      "Lots of work but good grades"

      "He is AWESOME!!!",
      "I am writing this before the exams just to be impartial. Professor Crowley is a great guy, very humorous and kind, willing to answer any question you may have and receive feedback from students. Classes are very hilarious but at the same time covers a lot of material per class. If u are a beginner in Programming studying at USC, he's the best for u",
      "Excellent technique and course material. Notes were very helpful and very detailed. Helped me a lot in interviews.",
      "I feel the course structure is need to be updated. Homeworks are very hectic (I mean it). Exams are relatively easy. Responds to emails very slowly. Never went to office hours. Course piazza discussion board really helped. Homeworks are really really good and next homework depends on present homework. You will develop site from scratch.",
      "Very good professor indeed. Highly recommended.",
      "I really like this professor. He has office hour almost every afternoon. He replied the email slowly. But you can find him and ask lots of questions during his office hour. He's so nice and patient. HW2 is the most hard part. But hw3 and hw4 are easier . I have a student-worker job on three of the week. But I can still get an A for this class",
      "One of the best at USC!",
      "very good professoR",
      "Great Professor",
      "Prof. Crowley is nice, and he's willing to help you, if you are willing to seek his help. If you talk to him or sit in on a lecture, you will realize that he is obviously very knowledgeable about the concepts he teaches. His only weak-points -- or perhaps they're weak-points of the class itself -- are poor communication of test topics + assignments",
      "CSCI 201 is a pretty badly structured class; however, Crowley made the experience not so bad. Attendance was not mandatory. Assignments could be long but were fairly easy. He seemed to understand how ridiculous the class was and taught what he believed were the more important parts of the course. One of the most fair teachers I've had.",
      "He's so cool :)",
      "Took his class for the summer. It was a great experience. He taught really well and is very helpful. He has more office hours than even the TA. He is always there for you. I would definitely recommend taking his class. I wish he took some of my other courses as well. Great learning experience.",
      "Very good teacher",
      "His assignments are really good and exams are pretty straight forward. This course is by far one of the best courses I have taken at USC.",
      "Excellent Professor, probably the best I've had at USC. Expect lots of programming, but you will learn web programming! Tests are straightforward, from programming assignments and lectures. Tests are written code so pay attention to lectures and do the programming assignments yourself! Highly recommended.",
      "One of the best professors I've has at USC.",
      "Took 102, 402, 571 and 599 with Prof. Crowley; he is simply an awesome prof!!!",
      "Crowley is a great professor. He is really easy in class and talks about concepts so clearly. It's definitely better to have some background in programming before taking his class as sometimes his class makes you sleepy. Most lectures don't last for full 2 hours. Really funny man, take it.",
      "Really a great professor to learn from and get to know in office hours. Easy to ask questions. Will regrade labs and homeworks very fairly. I knew most of the material beforehand, so I rarely went to class. 201 is hard in terms of workload, and you are expected to know Java or learn it really quickly on your own.",
      "Great professor. Really cares about students and is willing to take extra time to go over a grade or explain something to his students. Funny, nice, and good at explaining complicated cs topics",
      "Enthusiastic teacher who wants his students to learn. He does teach the class as if everyone has learned Java before, so if you don't have experience, you are in for a rough first couple of weeks. His lectures can get quite boring at times though if you already have programming experience; however, it usually doesn't go for the full 2 hrs.",
      "I really wish i talked to Crowley more. He is actually very funny a relatable guy. I was just extremely overwhelmed with CS coming into it, and if only I asked more questions in the beginning this class wouldve been a cakewalk. Anywho that's my fault and this was an awesome professor that answered any questions when i actualy did have them!",
      "Not many professors can just say that pointers are easy. But is one who can actually make it easy. Even my mom who doesn't know how to use Word can learn C++ from him.",
      "Crowley is one of the few professors I have encountered who I can tell genuinely cares about his students. He is a fair grader, and is excellent at explaining concepts to students. He will go out of his way to ensure you understand material and that you receive fair grades. I highly recommend taking a CS course with him.",
      "Organized lecturer, helpful, approachable. However, if you have no programming experience prior to joining this class, be prepared to do tons of work. Class moves like the speed of light, with three things due a week, and the class is full of computer-savvy but idiotic freshmen who believe that they're too good to be taught the basics.",
      "Crowley is a great professor - he's organized, lectures well, is available for questions, and creates a friendly classroom environment. I've heard Crowley's 402 class is harder, but I'm glad I took his.",
      "Crowley's short-sleeved shirts set the move for this laid back, extreme programming class. But bring your coding pants, because this is a real doozey of a thriller. I love Crowley's brown shoes. I'm not kidding.",
      "He's a Legend!",
      "TAKE THE NEW COMBINED CLASS WITH CROWYLEY AT ALL COSTS. I've had both 200 and 201, and Crowyley is a god send compared to the other guy.",
      "crowley is good at answering questions, but i really didn't like how he assigned hws when he did not finish lecturing. he would finish lecturing the material that we need for the hw 3-4 days before its due, so we literally had to code everything up in 3-4 days. Also, he wasn't very specific with the factory project. he kept on changing the req.",
      "Crowley is a good professor who taught us real-world strategy. His class was hard, but good. Very useful for those hoping to go into UI stuff.",
      "Pro. Crowley teaches the core of web development. His lectures are very clear and concise. He was accessible via e-mail and helpful with questions. If you do the homework, the tests aren't too bad, however, they are very long (pen and paper coding for 2 hrs!) The assignments were very lengthy. Lot's of work. Very practical (less theory =).",
      "U r in CS Dept n u hv nt taken a course under Prof. Crowley, then its ur mistake. U lost ur chance to be taught world's most genuine Prof. who really cares for his students and coursework.",
      "Moderate class. I would definitely do all projects on time, material is pretty straight forward but you don't want to wait and then rush. He is very nice and helpful. Make sure to visit him or his TA to clear up any doubts on projects.",
      "Prof Crowley is just awesome when it comes to teaching the web tech. Assignments are not easy and take time, but you will learn a lot if you spend enough time doing them. The exams are not hard. If you do the assignments. His TA was very helpful and got me through a lot of the installation and debugging problems. Thanks for the wonderful experience",
      "prof. I didn't pay that huge sum for you to read out notes from w3schools... though I got an A in this course but I feel that I lack a lot of knowledge... for a grad level class I was expecting u to teach design patterns and optimization related stuff but u covered only basics of PHP....",
      "Best professor i have met",
      "He is one of the best professors i've ever met. Great knowledge on OS and make studies really interesting. A nice person indeeed!",
      "Good job!",
      "Prof. Crowley was great for the first 8 weeks of the class--Clear and helpful lectures, good answers to questions, etc. After 8-weeks, we mingled with the 201 class and Crowley did not do anything substantial as far as teaching after that. Tests were difficult for some because he never stated expectations. Easy A though! he grades easy w/ x-credit",
      "402 is the shiznit, crowley is awesome. I can't imagine a class being harder than this, SAL is my home for the semester.",
      "I am taking Cal 3 this semester and its super easy, but it maybe because the standard of my Cal 2 class with TA Rajit was really high:Thanks to getting used to all those superhard problems given by TA,Cal 3 now seems a joke.Glad to have had Rajit as TA.",
      "Useful class,great TA.The structure of the class was based on Prof doing the basic groundwork and the TA working the harder examples.Whether you go to class or not, the TA's review sessions really matter and he made us work hard but for a good reason. Class average was highest among all Cal II sections,and I got good grade.Thank you TA Rajit!",
      "While I did not get A in this course,it was a good learning experience,and the Professor and TA are excellent.The Prof's lectures are standard,and the TA's discussions go over harder problems.TA even showed us how to work competition problems related to Cal II.Strongly recommend Prof Crowley and TA Rajit if you want to appreciate this material.",
      "Agree with person below.TA Rajit will start with simple problems,then goto the middle level ones and will definitely work the last and the hardest problems from every chapter.Professor on the other hand mostly does typical easier problems.But honestly TA runs the show,and if you do well in the end,its really because of TA,Prof is easy with grades:)",
      "The Professor-TA team of Crowley and Rajit is incredible.Both gave a lot of extra credit and the grading is fair. While the TA's quizzes were hard, he even gave opportunity to make up a quiz by going to seminar. The review sessions held by TA are extremely important,and the number of problems TA works out in discussion is staggering.Grade for me:A-",
      "Crowley is a good professor, but without TA Rajit's help it would be impossible to get a good grade. His review problems are good and in the end his teaching style elevated me from a B+ to a solid A.If your TA is Rajit, you will definitely do well.",
      "I would have been lazy in this class had it not been for TA Rajit's quizzes:There are always a couple of crazy problems on there, but no sweat if one didn't do well: TA gave lots of extra credit and opportunity to replace a quiz score with 20/20 by attending seminar. Cool Professor too.I got a kick out of &quot;interesting problems&quot; given by TA.Grade:A",
      "Crowley is good teacher,and the TA Rajit is a nice guy. There are always some crazy problems on the quizzes by TA,but if you dont do well there are several chances of extra credit,he even gave the chance to replace any quiz score of your choice with full score by attending seminar.Both Professor and TA gave many extra credit opportunities,so my A!",
      "Professor is quite helpful.TA provided some really unusual problems for practice:helped me see the extent of Cal II,which I had no clue about. Both Professor and TA give lots of extra credit,so its safe to say its possible to get A. One quiz had really hard problems,but as TA said, it was more to help us learn,and gave everyone at least 15/20 :-)",
      "Very clear and a slow teacher. Gave lots of extra credit. Does not like math department final so he tried to change. Midterms are all book problems. Very smart and loves his job",
      "It turns out....",
      "once in a lifetime professor!!! 402 is one of the best course available in USC!! Don't miss it...",
      "Crowley is one of the best professors in CS.",
      "Greatest Prof in CS dept. Geniunely cares for student progress.",
      "He was my professor for CS102 and 402. He knows everything he is teaching. Tests are ok. BUT HW are VERY HARD!! Graphic Games stuffs in 102 are not bad. CS402 is Crazy!! thousands lines of code.",
      "Excellent teacher. Great patience and there for help if needed. Class is of moderate difficulty, but that is the nature of the field of computer science.",
      "Crowley is the Golden God of the USC Computer Science department. He could teach OS theory to a brick wall and it would learn it and LIKE IT.",
      "No Comments",
      "The only prof I've ever met who said &quot;I don't know, but I'll find out.&quot; and actually came to the next lecture with the answer. Of course the class is hard, it's a 400 level CS course at the #6 university in the nation. You'll get out what you",
      "Prof Crowley is easily the best teacher I had in my entire USC career. He took the time to understand your question (either project or lecture) before trying to answer it. The only prof I've ever met who said &quot;I don't know, but I'll find out.&quot;",
      "The class is really hard, but Crowley really puts a lot into helping students understand. Everyonce and awhile he gets pissed, though, and will really snap at someone on the discussion board",
      "402 is just really hard as a class. Crowley makes it educational and he's pretty good at it. In 571, he's awesome. He knows web stuff better than anyone else at SC.",
      "Prof. Crowley is just an all round great professor. His course material and lecture topics are very well organized and relate to the real world. He uses great examples and goes out of his way to make sure every student is on the same page. All in all, he's a great prof for buiding great CS fundamentals.",
      "Excellent Teacher. You will learn a lot. The class is quite a bit of work, but its well worth it.",
      "Easy, good sense of humor.and very helpful.",
      "Not an O/S expert, and not as clever as he seems to think he is. Still, he's taught the material a number of times, so the lectures come across fairly smoothly . . . but you won't gain any special insights into the material from this particular instructo",
      "good professor, good lecture, a little tough assignment, go to take his class, you'll enjoy it",
      "No Comments",
      "Great professor, clear lectures, material was just HARD and programming assignments rough. start early.",
      "Good teacher, easy to understand...but this class is way too hard",

      "I just love Prof. Cote",
      "He is THE MAN for USC Computer Science. I took CSCI 104, 170 and 270 with him. His lectures are extremely engaging and inspirational, and his classes are so rewarding. Taking CS classes with him will build you a solid foundation for Computer Science. Would HIGHLY recommend him especially for 270 - Algorithms and 104 - Data Structures.",
      "Dr. Cot&eacute; is soooooo good. His lectures are extremely engaging! CSCI270 inspired my interest for algorithm and is definitely the best part of my learning experience this semester.",

His assignments, though difficult, are not unreasonable time-wise, and definitely advance your understanding of the material.",
      "I've taken 104, 170 and 270 with him. He's awesome in terms of explaining algorithms and inspiring students to think. He is so excited when we discussed about P/NP lol. The attendance is never mandatory, but you will definitely fail is you skip any class. Very recommend. His class is much harder than other professors', so get ready to think A LOT.",
      "Cote is a good prof if you ask questions in class and want to learn the material. Just make sure to actually ask questions about things you are confused about when he says &quot;Are there any questions?&quot; Don't be afraid of looking dumb",
      "Aaron Cote has been one of the best teachers I've had at USC so far. His lecturers and instructions are clear and concise, but if you don't understand it he always does his best to help you understand. Yes homework and tests seem hard, but the learning experience is so much better with them and it's almost necessary to understand the concepts well.",
      "I've learned about the beauty of computer science in this course! I'll remember the maze problem in homework forever, as it seems so difficult at first, but can actually be solved in a clever way only using pigeonhole principle.",
      "As others have said, this class has a crazy workload. Expect to spend 20+ hours on each homework (and possibly not finish). The tests aren't too difficult and are on material from lectures. Outside of AVL trees and Splay trees, most of the data structures aren't too difficult to understand and Aaron does a good job lecturing.",
      "He is a good lecturer, however the homework is way too difficult for me.",
      "CS104 is the hardest class I've ever taken, so it says a lot that I'm giving Aaron 5 stars. He is a great lecturer. He teaches the material with expertise and ease. If people here are complaining, it's because they didn't go to class, put off the assignments, and are generally upset about getting the grade they deserved. Aaron def helped me pass.",
      "He does a very good job in teaching. However, be prepared to treat CS104 and CS170 as a full-time job of the semester. do NOT enroll in any other class with large workload, or you will end up in HUGE trouble.",
      "Cote is a really good lecturer, very good at explaining things and is open to have people ask lots of questions during lecture which is very useful. 270 is a really hard class but if you do lots of practice you can definitely get an A.",
      "he is the man for lower-division CS classes",
      "This is the most difficult class I've ever taken. However, I wouldn't want any other professor for 104. Cote is very precise in his explanations, and is very good at answering his students questions. He will usually break up lectures into short Q&amp;A sessions after explaining some complicated concepts. Overall, take this prof!",
      "Cote is seriously the best professor I've had in my two years at USC. His lectures are awesome, the homeworks (all though there are a lot of them and can be pretty challenging) are never impossible and do an incredible job of reinforcing the material. Really passionate about the material and incredible at answering questions.",
      "I've taken 3 of his classes: CSCI-170 (easy A, i know my math), 270 (C, very hard class for me and I screwed up 19/80 on the final), and 499 (A-, I tried reasonably hard but not crazy). He really knows his stuff. Throws geeky jokes often. Very helpful both in class and at office hours. Highly recommend attending office hours if struggling over hws.",
      "Cote is a great CS professor. Really passionate about what he teaches and makes nerdy jokes every once in a while. Enjoyable lectures that are structured nicely. Attend class because he gives hints and important info for homework assignments.",
      "One of the best CS classes I've taken. Cote really knows his stuff and it shows in lecture. Concepts can be challenging but there are tons of office hours with the TAs. I took 270 a year after 170 and it was fine.",
      "Professor Cote is one of the best professors I have taken at USC. 104 is a tough class but he delivers the tons of material in a super clear way. Go to class and pay attention. ASK. At points in his lecture he would ask if there are any questions-take the chance to get all your confusion solved because Cote will explain until you fully understand.",
      "This is my third class with Cote. If you ever get the chance to take the Theory of Computing with him, DEFINITELY do it. It makes everything from 270 make so much sense.",
      "It is the 3rd class I have been with Aaron. The class material it self is very hard. But Aaron made it very clear and fun. I would totally take more class with him.",
      "Took him for 270. Got a B+ in CS170, definitely felt like I would get a B in 270 if I didn't change my study habits. Here's what I did - I did book problems and really tried to understand lectures. If I didn't get something, I would immediately go to office hours with CPs to clear things up. This strategy worked!",
      "After taking Cote for 170, I knew there was nobody better to take 270 with. The assignments are tough, but the quality of the lectures and the amount of material you'll learn which will help with interviews is so worth it. He's a hilarious professor, really cares about his students and the information he is teaching. 10/10 would recommend",
      "What an awesome professor. Never had a prof that encourages questions as much as him. A word to the wise: actually ask questions. If nobody asks anything then he assumes everybody understands perfectly, but he always encourages questions and I've seen the dumbest questions answered seriously, so don't be afraid to raise your hand!",
      "CS104 was a great introduction to algorithms and data structures. I learned a lot from this class but the homework was extremely demanding. There would be so many people asking for help from TAs and professors. So much so that I would not get the help I needed because there would just be a lack time for the instructors to help every student.",
      "He is awesome, but the course is hard",
      "CS104 and CS170 aren't easy classes. Cote isn't an easy professor. But these classes are the core of an CS engineer's background so I wouldn't expect them to be. Cote knows you are capable and will push you to answer your own questions instead of spoon feeding them to you. If you want to be confident in CS, take Cote.",
      "Professor Cote always had extra office hours and was available. Don't expect to get the answers out of him. He knows that you can rise to the challenge. I learned so much taking 270 from him and this class is a major reason I feel confident in my career as a software engineer.",
      "Aaron Cote is an incredible professor. He makes you work for it and makes sure you pay attention in class, but his explanations are crystal clear and I learned a LOT from him.",
      "Great professor. I like how he hand-writes lecture notes, which gave me time to write mine by hand. He cares if the students understand the material and is helpful during office hour. I would definitely take his class again.",
      "Aaron's lectures are good and interesting. He is very helpful in office hours and is there if you have any doubts. He will also through nerdy jokes in the class. Some of the jokes are funny.",
      "Before taking this class I was lost, but through the holy grace of A-A-ron Cote, I am found.",
      "Cote gives incredibly clear and precise lectures; you can really tell he puts the time into preparing for each class, and he knows material down solid. Gives very useful handout notes each lecture. Tests are quite difficult but passable, and homework is heavily weighted. Also, he's got a fantastically dry and nerdy sense of humor.",
      "Extremely smart, intelligent, brilliant. He grades pretty hard, but you will learn quite a lot. Stimulates student interest in the subject. Be prepared to work really hard, but it's so worth it!",
      "The only prof. I've sent an email to after the semester telling him how great the class was. Prof. Cote is eclectic, sure, but his lectures are clearer and more structured than any others I've had. Tests are fair, but certainly not easy. He somehow made the content seem interesting, which is impressive considering the class was on discrete math.",
      "Cote is a wonderful professor. I had him for both CSCI 104 and CSCI 170. He is exceptionally clear and he understands that students may not get the material at first. He is open during office hours and he explains multiple times when needed. He is very receptive to student feedback and for 170 he had amazing notes handouts that were amazing.",
      "I've never met a teacher that encourages questions than Cote. Don't get me wrong, this class is tough. But Cote is the person who makes it manageable -- if you go to class, pay attention, and ask questions, you will understand the course material. He is one of the most clear lecturers I've ever had, and I'm actually so sad he isn't teaching 270.",
      "Brilliant lectures; tough but insightful and great homework s.",
      "Cote was fantastic! My Discussion TA was reeeelly bad, but Cote was good enough that it didn't mater. He cares, he makes jokes, and his class actually teaches you something.",
      "You can tell he is really smart just from the way he lectures. He really cares about students having questions and will sometimes stop lecture until someone asks one. He speaks in a monotone but his lectures are pretty clear. He has a very nerdy, dry sense of humor if you're into that. Attendance is not mandatory but he doesn't post notes online.",
      "Cote is an awesome teacher who will take the time during and outside of class to make sure you understand the material. While his tests are hard, if you go to class and do the HW's there isn't a reason to get less than a B. He seems to genuinely care about his student's success and in my opinion is one of the best teachers of the CS department.",
      "no matter how hard the concept is, he can explain clearly. organized lecture. test questions are a little bit harder than hw problems. He encourages students to ask questions during class. Overall very smart guy who knows how to teach.",
      "Explains everything very clearly. Tries to make sure everyone understands. Maintains the class at an appropriate, yet challenging level. I enjoyed his sense of humor. Learned a lot!",
      "Unreal intelligent guy. I swear he has a computer in his head... That doesn't make his class easy though. Challenging material and complicated topics, but he explains everything many ways. Expect to work hard to get an A if algorithmic thinking isn't natural to you or you aren't a genius. Pray for dumb classmates because he grades on a bell curve.",
      "Good teacher with a good sense of humor. Very difficult tests and quizzes. If you pay attention in class, he covers all topics clearly and concisely, but lectures can be a bit boring, though he acknowledges this and tries his best to keep things interesting",
      "Aaron's course was quite difficult, but I feel I gained more from it than if I had taken it with someone else. He is very knowledgeable and available to students. I do feel CLRS is a more appropriate text than K&T.",
      "Amazing professor. Let you to figure your way out instead of just dumping the knowledge to you. Relatively hard final but it's Algorithm!",
      "AWESOME ...",
      "one word .... AWESOME",
      "He changed my life.",
      "Very good Prof :). Learnt a lot in his class. Homeworks and tests are tough though..",
      "Very clear in explaining algorithms. Only theory and pseudo codes, no actual programing. Listens to each student's doubts, clears them and only then he continues. Some students might feel that he goes a bit fast.",
      "Material is on the harder side but he is willing to go over it multiple times and is readily available outside of class. Course was curved making it easier to get a good grade. Gives homework on a near weekly basis which is difficult but doesn't really help to prepare you for the tests.",
      "Course is hard but he is always there to help you. He will make you learn Algorithms. The concepts are hard but he does not mind explaining them 100s times. He has in-depth knowledge of the subject.",
      "He is an awesome lecturer and presents the topics in a very clear manner. He doesn't hesitate to repeat himself and is highly available both in and outside classroom. However, he sets very high expectations and his exams/hwks are all very challenging and will keep you working around the clock. Take his course if you know you'll have the time.",
      "Fun class, learned a lot. But he is very challenging.",
      "Very difficult. Lectures are interesting and engaging. Very helpful and responsive."

      "Professor Shindler is hands down one of the best professors in Viterbi. He goes above and beyond to help students in any way he can. He is extremely fair and has so much respect for his students. Lecture is not mandatory, but you should go because he 1. covers lots of material and 2. is extremely entertaining. Don't question it take shindler!!",
      "Prof Shindler isn't for everyone. But I'd gladly take his class anytime again, because of his energy and care for his students. Love him or hate him, he has a passion for teaching and cares A LOT about his students, so if you work with him, you will definitely get where you want to be. Most teachers don't have that. Massive respect.",
      "I love Shindler! he loves teaching and wants to make sure you do well. The way he structures his class can definitely be very confusing, and skipping a lecture can be detrimental as some of the lecture notes and annotations can be incredibly unclear without him talking about it. Go to Office hours and you should be okay in this class",
      "Prof. Shindler is one of the few professors who I feel actually care about how well we do as students, and genuinely wants us to succeed. Sometimes lectures can be hard to follow and fast (but then again, I went to his 8am class). While his lectures are not entirely my style, he does a lot better than other professors, which makes him respected.",
      "Nice person. Also goes to pause for paws on Thursday.",
      "Professor Shindler is the most caring professor I have ever encountered in USC. He genuinely wants students to succeed and tries to teach as much as possible. He usually gives out note sheets in lectures which are structured and clear. Lectures are pretty fun. He is always positive and super responsible.",
      "Excellent professor! His CSCI 270 class in Fall 2018 was well-designed and went at the perfect pace to allow students to absorb material. Great lectures! He is always available during office hours to help students, and he is even willing to schedule time to meet students who cannot make his office hours.",
      "Great class! Interesting programming assignment. Looking for more coding challenges but unfortunately there's only one PA.",
      "Professor Shindler is the most energetic professor in the department I've seen so far. He enjoys teaching and interacting with the students. Clear Materials, not much homework, and straight-forward tests. Very caring for his students. The only note: his lectures easily go off on a tangent. You have to catch up with his flow to enjoy his teaching.",
      "Professor Shindler is one of my favorite professors at USC. He is genuinely a nice person and enjoys teaching, which is hard to find these days, especially in the computer science department. If you don't understand something, he will go out of his way to help you- you just have to actually reach out for help instead of just complaining online.",
      "Best CS professor I've had at USC. Turned discrete math from a bland topic into my favorite class - it was the only lecture I legitimately enjoyed attending. Highly recommend. And go to office hours!",
      "A lot of people in this course will say that he is too hard/confusing etc. but the reality is, the content of the course is just difficult. He does sometimes assume that students know more than they do, but he is very flexible with his office hours and willing to meet to clarify any confusion. I would recommend him.",
      "CS170 is truly an easy class - just a quick introduction to some basic techniques in computer science. He didn't go too far and I like his lectures a lot. If there's one thing I think could improve, it should be lack of coding practice. However I realize that it's a theoretical class so I shouldn't be expecting coding.",
      "Shindler is great. He goes off on a lot of tangents and makes jokes that sometimes miss -- almost always miss with graduate students -- but you can tell that he very clearly means well and really wants all of his students to succeed. He is very smart, obviously, and teaches things as clearly as he can. Sometimes the topics in 567 can be confusing.",
      "Very good professor at explaining basic computer science concepts. The course is easy itself but the graders don't give good feedback on exams and homework. I'm often confused about how I lose points.",
      "One of my favorite professors of all time. A kind person and amazing lecturer.",
      "As far as professors go, Shindy is bae. Easily one of the nicest, funniest, most relatable professors I've ever taken. He's a great mentor, accessible outside of class, and hosts student events/sponsors ACM. His lectures are funny, interactive and intuitive and he really wants you to succeed. Stop by his office to chat even as his alum; he's great.",
      "He is a great professor and very friendly. But I am getting tired of him for constantly diverting almost EVERY question students asked to other stories or experiences of his. It took me 2 hours to get my 3-5 questions answered because of that. I will stop going to his office hour in the future classes of his because it'll be just a waste of my time",
      "I thought he was very enthusiastic in lectures and passionate about the material. He seems to really care for his students, and he's accessible outside class.",
      "He is the man.",
      "Great professor, really inspired me to want to know more about computer science. I believe the homework questions were just about the right amount of difficulty, and overall the class really teaches you how to problem solve.",
      "Shindler is a very good professor. I really messed up on the first midterm but ended up doing really well throughout the course. Ended up with an A-. He's very passionate about the subject and really helpful to accommodate anyone that asks for help. Love this guy!",
      "Your classic quirky computer science guy who is super passionate about the subject matter. Although Shindler really cares about his students, he sometime jumps right into doing problems and does not explain the concepts clearly. He is very accessible outside of class so make sure to see him in office hours to ask any follow up questions.",
      "Shindler is amazing!",
      "I simply love his algorithms lectures",
      "Lecture quality is OK, but home assignment is too hard, there is only one experienced teaching assistant for the whole class. Almost everybody look at open source solutions, the professor is OK but I do not believe the class give good costumer experience.",
      "Pretty good teacher. Moves through the material fast. Is a little awkward, but his jokes are so cheesy you gotta laugh. Seems to really love being at USC. Class was hard for me, but not for others. Grades fairly on a median B- engineering curve. I didn't get the best grade but I deserved it.",
      "Awesome teacher. Doesn't take it personally when you don't show up to class. Lectures well. I would bend my schedule around to make sure I had this guy as opposed to any other professor.",
      "Cool lecturer. Really clear specifications and some jokes.",
      "Great professor, takes time to make sure students understand the concepts. Very willing to help during office hours.",
      "Michael is a great teacher. He tries to keep students engaged the best he can, explains things clearly, and even gives out note sheet handouts. The exams are very difficult, but that's fine due to the immense curve. Homeworks can be used as grade boosters. Overall great class!",
      "Shindler tells dad jokes and lectures are fun. He goes slow and if anyone still has questions he won't move on to the next topic until everyone is clear, just depends on whether or not students are asking questions. He'll make you feel good about asking questions. He is SO nice, helpful, and approachable. I hope to take another class with him!",
      "Favorite professor at USC so far. He's willing to help you as much as you need. His jokes made lectures entertaining but he also explains the material well. Wish I could have him for more classes.",
      "I enjoyed lecture and discussion, but it was extremely hard to know how and what to focus on for exams since there is such a wide breadth of material. This was especially hard for the final since we did not have any guidance or focus on what to study. I felt like I got a 30% on the final but ended up with an A in the class. Lol?",
      "Professor Shindler is one of the best professors at USC. He is always responsive and he holds extensive office hours if you need help. CSCI 499 was an amazing class, even if it was just created for the semester in which it was run. It was well-organized, interesting, and the lectures were great.",
      "Michael is fantastic! Never really considered myself a math person before, now considering a switch to an Applied Math major. CS kids tend to struggle with/dislike 170-- this may be since most take 104 concurrently. He appreciates hard work and will stay 1-2hrs past office hours to help you out. Tests are tough and cover *a lot*, so study up.",
      "Great CS prof I had at USC. He is serious about teaching and give us helpful handouts. Like the class materials but hws are hard. Just go to TA and office hours. He's patient and nice with students. Really understanding!",
      "First half of the course went smooth,this summer. Second half , um, somewhat hasty.",
      "CS 170 is a pretty dry class but he makes very interesting with his anecdotes and analogies. I went to all his lectures and found myself paying attention to him and hence even though barely staph died for the class I got a very high A. You don't have to go to lecture to get good grades but certainly increases your chances.",
      "Seriously one of the best teachers at USC. Super clear and helpful and really cares about his students. Also not too shabby on the eyes.",
      "He really cares a lot about his students learning the material. He makes everything as clear and easily understandable as possible, which is a feat given how difficult the material is. He's extremely helpful if you go to office hours as well. His exams are fair, but if you don't put in the work, you definitely won't do well. Very fair grader.",
      "Lecture: Very clear, always invites you to ask questions, gives good handout Grading: Everything is very well thought out and considered Homework: homework is helpful, appropriate difficulty Exams: Very fair, what you will expect Person: Shindler is a guy that CARES, really if you go to his office hours you can tell. TAKE HIM! :D",
      "Great stuff. Very helpful Exams were easy if solved all assignment problems",
      "Definitely one of the best professors I've had at USC. He keeps the lectures funny and interesting, and is always super clear. He also has a very fair way of grading homework and scheduling when assignment are due. I would highly recommend taking his classes!",
      "I attend his discussion sessions. He is brilliant. He knows the subject matter really well & I tend to understand the concepts better after attending his classes.",
      "Professor Shindler is downright an amazing professor. Just because the subject matter is tough doesn't mean he isn't explain it well. In fact, he makes tough concepts easy to understand. Great lecturer with a good sense of humor. ALWAYS available to ask questions, not matter what, he'll make time. Most of all very fair, he wants you to succeed.",
      "Brilliant professor makes you work hard but it's so worth it.",
      "Prof. Shindler is one of the best prof in USC. He explains concept very clearly( if you read the topic in advance that will help you a lot). He is very kind and very helpful person. He replies to all your emails within 24 hrs or within half hour even. His assignments are very tough and you might have to ask for extension also. But worth taking.",
      "The best class you'll ever take! Prof. Shindler is awesome. He makes xkcd and Star Wars references during class. His assignments are hard but they're worth it. They are very amusing. (Like helping Indiana Jones retrieve stolen treasure using network flow). This is true even in exams. Very helpful during office hours. He's Excellent!",
      "He is a great professor. His lecture impress me a lot though his material is hard. Well, everybody knows algorithm is not easy. He is highly responsible in email and he is really patient to student. His office hour is always like a RAID in World of Warcraft but you can also make an appointment. I will use his phrase as a summary: excellent!",
      "The professor is great. He can clarify all problems clearly. Definitely, it is not an easy course, but the payment worth. If you spend more time on the course materials and make sure that you understand the questions he marked out on the textbook, you will get a good grade.",
      "really good professor, he is young but he explain things clearly and he really understand students. All in all, he is a very good teacher.",
      "Excellent professor. If you get the chance, take 570 with Shindler. He is one of the best professors at USC. He has clear explanations of the material and answers any doubts. 10/10! wonderful",
      "Nice professor. The class was a bit useful for interview prep, if you are starting from level 0.",
      "Micheal is a really teacher, he knows a lot and is ready to help you whenever you need him. But you might need a little basis about algorithms to really enjoy his lessons.",
      "So far so good, excellent!Michael is excellent, perfect, humorous teacher iff without his TA Rajan! We should stop Ranjan to become the fastest person who will obtain PhD degree in USC history.",
      "Micheal is a new professor. But we all like him because of his rich knowledge and great sense of humor. Taking his lecture make me comfortable, though sometimes the course content messed me up a lot."

      "All I did was come home review whatever he taught. I did all the Homeworks and attended most of the extra credit as well. I was super scared of Coding and now it's like I really like it a lot. He is simply too good. The extra credits boosted my grade. Overall, if you're scared of coding, this is going to be best icebreaker.",
      "Professor Saty cares a lot about his students and is an extremely friendly and interesting man. He's super easy to learn from one-on-one, but his lectures are pretty boring. The midterm and final were both open Internet and fairly straightforward. The homework was a bit challenging. I only went to lecture once a week and lab 3 times and I got an A.",
      "Prof. Saty's animation and simulation course is just AMAZING. Having grown up playing games and watching animated movies, always wondered how they are created, now I am learning how! Prof. Saty has tons of industry experience, and is a great teacher. I love his slides, nerdy jokes and funny CG stories he tells in class.",
      "Prof. Saty is among the best. Took his databases course last fall, learned more than I ever thought possible, made me take up data science as my future career path! He explains concepts with crystal clarity, provides enough examples to make sure you understand 100%. Oh, and he's awesome overall, very considerate, very helpful. Recommendation: 100%.",
      "I liked the course. I wonder if he made the final so hard because everyone was whining for points on the message board. In any case, he provided a ton of learning material for anyone who wants to study further into the field. I probably won't but I'm glad that he provided more than enough to inspire those that will.",
      "Wonderful lecturer, definitely is passionate about making sure everyone learns. He managed to make databases, which could easily be a dry topic, fun. Super smart and knowledgeable about many topics too, and works hard to help you understand. Take class with Saty if you can! Exam is difficult but really pushes you to think.",
      "I'm taking Prof's CS585 right now.. GREAT! Every lecture I learn so much, my head spins in amazement. He gives good, practical info we can use in interviews and jobs.",
      "Professor Saty is an amazing Professor. He is helpful, caring, very cool, funny, intelligent, knowledgeable and super enthusiastic! I took his database systems course and absolutely loved the experience and learnt quite a bit. You should go to his office hours to check out his very colorful office, if not for anything else!",
      "Professor Saty's syllabus goes beyond basic DB to encompass data science related topics. His enthusiasm is unmatchable and he tries to ensure that students learn something useful rather than just preparing them for tests. He provides enough resources required to master data science. This was undoubtedly the most fun class Ive taken at grad school.",
      "First time teaching 104. Kinda rushed through topics, but otherwise a SOLID connection to have and an amazing person in general. 104 itself is brutal, but Saty helped me push through it. Go to OH's! His office is a mini animation studio, and he can talk for HOURS about cool things in the animation/entertainment industry plus life in general! Wise!",
      "He's so brilliant and changed the course structure of the boring CS585. Taught all the conventional stuff like SQL, Transaction Mgmt etc in half semester and then taught new things like Hadoop, Map Reduce, NoSQL etc. He's also very caring and goes out of the way to help his students! Best professor at USC",
      "Awesome prof! He made lectures really interesting and even went beyond the scope of the class to show you cool things in computer science!",
      "I am SO enjoying this class, and learning a lot. I had no idea computers did so much, no idea how they do all that. This course is teaching me really cool things! Prof. Raghavachary is just amazing. His lectures are clear, informative, and pure magic. If you need a Quantitative GE class, TAKE THIS ONE!",
      "I am coding newbie, was scared to sign up for an intense six week course. All my friend recommend Prof. Saty heavily so I take a chance and regisrter. Boy I feel lucky! Prof was GREAT like I heard from my friend. We did C++ first and Java. Every lecture was very clear, homework and lab helped too, a lot. As a result I now feel pretty confident.",
      "Dr. Saty's is the best course for me, in all my MS (out of 7 courses I took). His lectures are exceptional, wish all my classes were this good. You will learn a LOT from each lecture. Even the homeworks seem well thought out, they were fun to do, even. TAs and graders were knowledgeable as well, overall it was a solid experience. Much thanks.",
      "Prof. Saty's spring 2016 Databases course is, hands down, the very best course I have ever taken.. ever! The pre-midterm portion was about classical theory and so on. After the midterm, the course got wildly cool and useful! It was so useful that I could land an internship (at Visa!) with my non-CS creds, but with Prof. Saty's teaching. GREAT.",
      "Prof Saty is the best of the best, a rare breed. Thanks to Part II of the reorganized course, I am now super clear on Big Data, Data Science, machine learning and all these topics that were just words to me before. Prof Saty not only knows a lot, but he is also excellent at teaching. II am super sad that the course ended :(",
      "Smart man from IIT, achieved three masters and one PhD from OSU. Sixteen years in industry, with the hobby following the latest trend in the technology. I am applying my own PhD, and Saty delivers me an open sea for surfing the high waves.",
      "He is probably the greatest teacher in the department, very clear on explaining and is willing to help you a lot. Possibly the only drawback of him is that his office is always full of passionate students and he is literally tooo patient to explain every problem they have (so you might wait long)",
      "I cannot say enough positive things about both Saty and CSCI 103. He is legitimately one of the nicest people I have ever had and his compsci jokes are so adorably nerdy, they make my day. CSCI 103 is one of the best classes I have taken at USC.",
      "In depth knowledge of concepts. Highly Recommended",
      "Awesome teacher, super energetic and makes lectures fun!",
      "Only 2 weeks in, I am hooked :) I'm a Freshman, female, came here from a small town in the East Coast. Love the idea of a CS major, heard coding is hard. Prof. Saty has made me realize that I CAN DO IT! Gonna do well, gonna rock. Dr. Saty is very knowledgeable, AMAZING at explaining things, gives plenty of code samples. He is even funny! Loving it.",
      "Prof Saty is the best of the best of the best. This summer, he taught TWO languages (C++, Java) in 6 weeks. I felt scared going in, because programming is supposed to be hard. But Prof made things so clear, after a week, I lost my fear and started loving the class. Amazing lectures, very unique style. Loved his lectures, labs, hws. OMG COOL!",
      "Dr. Saty is a very successful guy and at the same time, very humble and respectful. His course is not very easy and not very hard. He is not a tough grader. His lectures are long but clear and useful. He gives a lot of extra credits. Once you finish his course, You will understand what a \"renderer\" and the graphics field in general are about.",
      "Well, I love this professor and this amazing experience.",
      "Learning C++ from the dear professor, switch to Java next week. Despite very short time, professor make C++ be easy and clear. Just amaze by him. I have taken other C++ courses including online ones, read many books but was confused. Now professor has fully educated me. He is brilliant, kind and patient, and knows a lot (everything!). Thanking you!",
      "For this non-CS major (and others I have spoken with), Prof. Saty made CS be alive, exciting, awesome. i now have a much better idea of what goes on inside my iPhone and Mac :) And, I know Python basics VERY well! I had no idea programming could be this much FUN, a homework problem was to do greenscreen replacing.. Just AMAZING. Prof. Saty, merci.",
      "Prof Raghavachary is truly an exceptional professor. Despite a magnificent career and intelligence on another plane of being, Prof Saty is never above sitting down with a student to answer the most basic of questions. Whatever you ask him about programming, he has insightful advice. He once sat with me for three hours helping me animate. Awesome!",
      "Prof. Saty is my favorite, EVER! Never had anyone quite like him. He has this amazing and rare combination of clarity, intelligence, compassion, humor and humility, so awesome to see. Lucky to take 101 with him, I know I am set for life with all the things we are learning. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this class (heck, ANY class!) from the prof.",
      "easy homeworks, one test, overall a really light courseload. Saty is always energetic and wants to make programming fun, which he actually does",
      "OMG he's GREAT! This is my first prog. class EVER, I'm a non-CS major (Econ). Prof. Saty is incredibly clear in his presentations, I UNDERSTAND Python 100% thanks to him. Heck, if this continues I might consider declaring a CS minor, lol. If I do, Prof. Saty, would you please be my advisor? USC, could Prof. Saty teach ALL of our classes?! RESPECT",
      "My first CS course, and a programming one too! Was dreading it, but now I don't have to. Prof. Saty has already convinced me through his lectures that Yes, I can do this! Thank you prof. Looking forward more Python amazements as the term progresses. Oh, and you are funny, sweet and kind :)",
      "BEST prof I have come across. I transferred to USC from MIT, he is better than anyone I have had from both schools. Dr. Saty has fueled my passing interest in CG and made it into a career ambition. I used to think that CG was hard, and therefore ignored it. But now, I realize it is hard but doable and likable too. Thank you, Dr. Saty.",
      "He's awesome, funny and clear about the topics.",
      "Awesome.",
      "one of the best",
      "Easily the best of the best. Our dear \"Prof. Saty\" just rocks. Crystal clear lectures, awesome slides, great humor, ultra helpful. His \"BigFD\" data science lectures were The Bomb. He has gobs of industry experience and a truckload of degrees, but is so freaking humble. I am grad student, hoping to be like him someday. USC: hire more profs like him.",
      "Awesome professor..",
      "One of the best professors i have across in my entire educational career !",
      "Best professor so far. Good knowledge.",
      "Great Lectures. Makes lectures interesting to attend . Assignments are also cool.",
      "Great teacher! Makes the subject very interesting",
      "An excellent professor, very enthusiastic about the subject and highly knowledgeable. Has an answer to any question asked!! Very clear in teaching. Assignments are fun to do though take some time. Exams are easy and interactive ;). I wish every professor at USC was like Saty!!",
      "I have yet to meet a professor who is better in any way than Prof. Saty - he brings to the classroom, a valuable industry (DreamWorks!) perspective, is so humble, smart+nice+funny. His explanations of &quot;difficult&quot; CG concepts are GOLD. He needs to write books to crystallize all that wisdom. Oh wait - he already has! Prof. Saty, you ROCK. God Bless.",
      "Prof. Saty = God. Smart, funny, nice - doesn't get better than this. Easily the best class I have ever taken at USC. And he does this part-time! Amazing.",
      "Incredibly good at getting concepts across, very patient, helpful, cheery (what DOES he eat for breakfast daily&#63;). Possibly this is the very best class of all my 4 years of undergrad. Prof. Saty inspires me to do graduate work in CG, something I am seriously considering. HE IS THE BOMB.",
      "Dr. Saty is an &quot;one and only&quot;. Before him, I used to think that CS SUCKED, lost all interest in it. But he completely changed my outlook. With his wisdom, smiles and energy and good nature, I'm sure he has made a mark on many of my classmates. USC needs to CLONE him! Thanks for everything, Prof. Saty.",
      "BEST prof. I have ever had in my 4 years at USC. He is GOLD. I have never seen a better combination of knowledge, passion and wit. Genuinely smart, genuinely nice.",
      "* smart * funny * stimulating * helpful * energetic Run, don't walk, to sign up and enjoy his class. BEST class I ever took at USC!"

      "It took couple of months to correct my grade, but he followed thru. Honestly, some of the topics were boring, but he made lectures actually enjoyable. I'd take him again, maybe not for this class.",
      "Most of your grade for this class consists of one large group project, which means that your team members will either make or break your semester. Lectures are pretty useless since they do not help you on the assignments, but random pop quizzes are sometimes given that are worth a decent amount. Prof is pretty good, but the material is very dry.",
      "The class is dry. Prof knows his stuff. Snafu with grading at the end took weeks to correct. My guess is having so many TA's and CP's caused it. Teach 3 sections of 50 instead of 1 with 150 students. The room was ridiculous, felt like can of sardines. Not sure I learned something useful, but my friends who already graduated say they use this stuff.",
      "Really nice prof. There was aproblem with my grade and he fixed it. The class is dry and tehre was alot to do, but my only regred is how I chose my team mates.",
      "I am actually using stuff this semester I learned in his class. He said the software engineering is important. and it is, I see that. We covered so much and he kept the class intersting.",
      "Great prof, tough class, lots of work. The project was interesting but very time consuming. It wasn't always clear how the lectures relate to the project.",
      "Update the book! Enjoyed the class but textbook should be better.",
      "Patterns and styles! Study those. You'll need them - on his exams and at work!! The book is a little outdated but I keep using chapter 4 and 5 like a reference guide.",
      "Take this class! It's not an easy A, but he is fair and super-knowledgible.",
      "Take this class! WIsh the book had more on cloud. Stuff Nenad explained in class is so usefull to what I'm doing.",
      "Great prof. Enjoyed the class. One of the nicest faculty at SC.",
      "Strong class. I will recommend it to my coworker. A lot of it seems like common sense, but we don't do this in our projects. Why? After listening to this class, I know why.",
      "OK class, a little boring. Prof was good.",
      "It was an OK class. Group project was a nightmare. He should assign team members. Some people in the class had friends so it was easy for them, bunch of of us didn't.",
      "He's alright. Can't say I'm not glad it's over. SoftEng is dry.............",
      "It was lots of work, but the class is actually pretty easy. Lots of common sense for anyone who ever had an internship in a company.",
      "Easy grader!",
      "The textbook is not very useful. Prof said it is, but I disagree. :-)",
      "I survived the exam and project! :-)))",
      "Don't bother with textbook. He says to read chapters, but his slides are enough. Final was much harder than midterm. Project was really great, I think I can figure out how airbnb and uber is built.",
      "Good guy and tries hard, but the project was too much. I didn't get along with my teammates and he wouldn't let us change teams. But then I found out he let another team separate into two teams. He's a very good speaker, but the lectures were actually kind of boring. Doing software engineering is way better than hearing about it.",
      "The midterm was too open-ended, the final too specific. It's clear he hadn't taught this class for a while. I'd still take his class.",
      "The lectures are interesting even if the subject is dry. The project was fun. Make sure to pick your teammates carefully.",
      "I am very glad to learn about Android and security. The lectures could tie better to homework. Prof expects us to read text book and papers and figure out everything for ourself. TA is very good. I think I learn a lot but it could be easier.",
      "I have worked as an intern in Bay area last summer. I interviewed for the same company this week. They do IoT and stuff they asked was almost all from 589. This class was much useful. The topic I presented in class will become my job in May and project was really hands on.",
      "Good assignments, but you have to work for it. Wish the TA and other student helping with assignments could speak better, very hard to understand. But they know Android.",
      "Got offer for internship yesterday. Half of questions on my interview were for things I learned from this class. Some readings weren't great and student presentations were too much (prof should just lecture because he knows much more about material and some students weren't good presenters), but we covered many things and they are cutting edge.",
      "Assignments are about modern tech. Android security. Have to read alot but its a good combination of older and latest things. Lectures are kind of long, but prof. explains very clearly. If you come to class you will definitely learn alot.",
      "Not the most interesting subject, but it is important in the real world. Prof is good. Lectures are long, but if you pay attention you will learn something.",
      "Amazing lectures. Ruhollah Shemirani (TA) spends a lot of time getting you up and running with the assignments and projects, and really knows what he is talking about.",
      "Professor's clarity is second to none. He organizes the content very well and has a rare ability to make any topic interesting. Roohy (TA) has a really good attitude, and all my exchanges with him have been good. I would work with these guys again.",
      "One of the best teachers I have had to date. The course is real informative though it is hard. Course project is usually useful and is always about a current hot topic.",
      "Really good teacher. Lectures are truly amazing. You have to know all the materials and study the textbook. But in the end it will be good for you. (As this was named \"bible of software architecture\" in a famous Amazon review.",
      "This course is a great experience for me and it shaped my understanding of software development. The professor is really knowledgeable and and has fantastic presentations during semester. The TAs are usually PhD students and are willing to help you 24*7. The exams are not easy and you should have definitely learned stuff before.",
      "Only 2 weeks in, I am hooked :) I'm a first year grad, female, came here from a small town in the East Coast. Love this class, and the teacher assistant.",
      "Good teacher,",
      "He puts in a lot of interest. Is a really good teacher. Exams are tough but they really help you understand the course material. TA is also helpful. He also put time in this. Project is actually useful, but a little vague at the first glance.",
      "Very bad with project evaluation.Makes blind assumptions about student's performance.Dosen't have any clue about student's abilities.The course is awesome but the way he evaluates the project & individual team members is the worst of all in USC.(0.5/5.0)",
      "An excellent professor who explains very well and answers doubts and encourages students to participate in class."

      "Professor Goodney seems to be a solid choice for CS courses, but that's really hard to tell based off taking CS109. CS109 is a weird class where you're introduced to all of these different topics that span the entire width of CS. But not enough to implement anything, just scratch the surface of everything. Well, it's required so have fun w it.",
      "He's really nice but DON'T TAKE CS UNLESS YOU'RE GOOD AT MATH OR SCIENCE. I want to be a lawyer-- huge mistake to take this class, my pristine GPA is now tainted because I thought a CS course would be fun to take. Goodney tries his best to get the information across but the concepts are really hard to grasp unless you're already STEM-oriented.",
      "Goodney likes these topics, is well-prepared, and his lectures are clear. No matter how basic, you do learn theory and it's really relevant in later classes. Make sure to think about the material and how to apply it instead of just memorizing, you might do better on tests.",
      "A lot of people here particularly complain about his CSCI 109 course, and honestly that is not very fair to him. To start, I also took 103 with Goodney, and he was a great instructor for both. However, 109 is and INTRO to Computer Science, typically for freshman. So if CS isn't for you, yea it'll probably be boring and maybe even torture.",
      "Goodney for CS103 is generally helpful. His lectures are slow, but they are helpful and he takes time after every slide to ask if anyone has questions. He is generally passionate about the class and actually cares about his students, so his office hours are helpful. If you have him for CS109, it's probably pretty boring, but I blame the course more",
      "Andrew Goodney is a good professor, he definitely cares about students. The problem is CS109, the course material is really over the top, which makes the lectures very dull. The size of the lecture also doesn't help; there are too many people in one lecture and many times I found myself getting those sleep hours in his lecture.",
      "Interesting lectures, hes great. understanding. Really enjoyed the class, he helped me out. Take cs109 and cs103 with him.",
      "Professor Goodney is a great lecturer who gets the topics instilled into your minds as long as you pay attention. Passionate about the topics and has a good sense of humor, so he can make these topics fun while still learning tons. highly recommend him",
      "Great professor, communicates and teaches well, and is always happy to meet outside of class or to share his expertise during office hours",
      "Lecture slides cover everything you need to know for the class - you don't need to read the textbook. Not the most engaging lecturer but very clear in requirements and always willing to help. Tests are slightly more applied but fair.",
      "Goodney is a good teacher. He's massively changed up his teaching and he is a fair teacher. For CS103, he's got it going. Goofy guy.",
      "Goodney's teaching skill has improved a lot, at least in CS 103. Lecture is very clear. He really cares his student, willing to help with assignments during office hours.",
      "Goodney is a much better lecturer for CSCI103 than for CSCI109. His lectures in this class were much more interesting and he seems to be more comfortable teaching this material. Overall, the class is fairly easy for most people with prior programming experience.",
      "Goodney is actually a great guy (super wholesome) and great professor. Would recommend CSCI102 for absolute beginners in CS, but going to lectures and doing the in-class exercises should help anyone succeed in CSCI103. As for CSCI109, just make sure you understand how things work; the topics are actually really cool!!",
      "Prof Goodney has a good knowledge of CS who is able to answer all questions in and out of class. He also responds quickly and gives good feedback. His lecture, however, is not well paced. The exams are more theoretical than practical, so don't miss anything in lectures or ppts. Newbies in CS had better take CSCI102 before taking this course.",
      "He was ok",
      "Goodney is a solid professor, he's good at explaining tough concepts and he's very accessible outside of class and loves to talk about any CS topic.",
      "Goodney's a straight baller. He is very clear and makes it easy to understand lecture material. Funny guy, too.",
      "Overall, Goodney is a decent professor. He is accessible outside of class and does his best to help students understand the material. On the other hand, his lectures often lost my attention. Also, having taken this class without prior programming experience, I found that it progressed at a very fast pace, inconsiderate of beginners like me.",
      "Prof Goodney is pretty under rated. He's a caring guy, always willing to help his students. Lectures are very important. Make sure not to miss those since they move fast. If you're unsure about something, don't hesitate to ask, he's willing to clear all your doubts. Assignments, and the class overall was pretty fun. Would love to take him again!",
      "Goodney is an amazing professor! He makes learning coding interesting. He is very accessible outside of class and really cares about your success within computer science.",
      "Awesome guy, great teacher all around.",
      "Not gonna lie, you WILL struggle without prior coding experience with Goodney. He moves fast, but your opinion will vary based on how much you know already. He's got a good personality and obviously does try to make it enjoyable, or as much as an intro class can be. Reach out to TAs/CPs when needed, because this is a sink or swim weeder class.",
      "He seemed to know what he was talking about but had some difficulty relaying that knowledge in his instruction, especially in his earlier classes. While his teaching will likely improve, I would recommend to cover most material yourself rather than rely on lectures, especially if you have limited prior programming experience.",
      "Such a nice guy, but had some trouble at the beginning of the semester on how to teach. But I can see that his lecturing has greatly improved through the course of the semester",
      "He is knowledgeable and totally qualified to teach the class. He may probably not one of the very best professors in the department since this is his first year, he is definitely more than \"good\".",
      "Well, acceptable",
      "He is a nice guy",
      "He is a nice person and the course is not as hard as the other comments said. In an introductory computer science class, you should not expect the professor to teach you every thing and you should be prepared to write some codes. I gave out a five because I know that he does not deserve a 1 overall."

      "Prof. Shamsian teaches topics very clearly , he might sometimes go slow but he just makes sure everyone is on the same page and that everyone is understanding the stuff.",
      "At the beginning of the semester, I felt that he was a good prof and he explained everything clearly. Later in the semester, I hear lots of students ranting about their profs. This made me realize that he is one of the best. I found the last 3 lectures so interesting that I felt like I was watching a movie.",
      "I really enjoyed the class and Im glad he taught mostly from the book. His lectures combined with the textbook as a reference was a great learning experience. Would definitely study under him again.",
      "This is the only professor that makes me think USC worth it's tuition of my master degree. Great explanation, and clear in every step of algorithms, and great help finding jobs.",
      "Professor Shamsian is an amazing lecturer. When you're listening to him in class, you won't even notice the lecture is 3 hours long. Although the class is certainly challenging and graders can be quite tough, he manages to present topics in a way that is very clear and insightful. He also addresses questions very well during discussion sessions.",
      "Fantastic at explaining concepts. The TAs are very tough on grading. Your entire grade is dependent on your exam scores, but he curves your final grade, which is good. Very approachable and friendly, but make sure you do your homework. Simply understanding the concepts at a high level won't cut it here.",
      "I found Professor Shamsian classes very helpful, his 3 hrs lectures were very interesting, I never felt that it was too much to take at the end of the classes. The amazing thing about Professor Shamsian is even the toughest of the topic is taught with such smoothness, that it makes that topic very clear to you.",
      "He is an excellent professor in my opinion. But some have -ve opinions about him is not because of issue with professor actually, but with the way course is structured. It is hard for anyone to listen for more than 45 minutes whereas the algo classes are almost 3hr lectures. Hence watching lecture videos nextday makes you understand how good he is",
      "He is very intelligent and responsible for teaching, and TAs are very helpful and enthusiastic. Reading textbook is required. Doing homework and past exam paper is highly recommended. Usually student would not receive grade below B, but getting A or A- needs good understanding of concepts, rather than only understanding of past exams.",
      "Pretty challenging course for someone with minimal CS exposure in his/her undergrad. There were several moments in the class where I was left completely flummoxed and dumbfounded by the concepts being explained. Just going through the class lectures won't be enough. Not by a long shot. It's especially trickier when the average is always above 70%.",
      "Completely exam oriented course! Loads to read from the textbook! Most of the material is covered by the professor! Do not miss his lectures on Dynamic Programming! Exercises and HW questions were brilliant but carry no weight to the final grade! 100% exam oriented course! Strict grading guidelines! As an EE major, highly recommend this course!",
      "This class is the most valuable class I've taken in USC so far. Even a student like me with no background in CS can follow lectures. Professor and TAs are patient and helpful. Assignments do not count to grade but are very good material for practice and preparing exams. Textbook is very useful, and please follow reading schedule.",
      "Professor Shamsian is pretty clear about the materials and illustrates clear enough for most of the students to understand. The topics covered are crucial to job interviews, and you do learn a lot from this course. However, grading's tough: it only depends on 3 tests, once a month or so. You'll only get a B for being median. Got to wok hard.",
      "Shawn made this course intense by gathering PhD students as Graders. They are harsh graders and if you want to regrade for more points, they will deduce you more points. You will feel the chill when you step into the exam. Students typically fight for grade till the last minute. But Prof. Shamsian is a nice and approachable person.",
      "Lectures are good and keeps you involved. :)",
      "Awesome prof. with a good sense of humour, having good basics in bachelors helps a lot; Really appreciate his style of teaching, took the course very well. Assignments are tough and makes you think and fun to solve (wish more questions were given in discussions). Advise to students- do assignments regularly even though they are not for grading.",
      "The class is quite good . I feel dynamic programming could be explained better . DO NOT EXPECT to be spoon fed , if your bachelor's concepts are not clear , it will be tough for your in the class even though the professor will make an attempt to touch every area . Attend classes and discussion regularly , do your hw on time and it will be easy.",
      "Need to dedicate hours to the subject on a daily basis. Exams are of medium to hard difficulty. Lectures are interesting and the professor has a good sense of humor. Assignments are not graded but highly recommended.",
      "Great Lectures. Have to spend time to get a good grade. Homework's are there, but doesn't expect to submit! better you do to learn. Tests are mediocre to tough. Previous exam papers really helps. Would definitely recommend this course under him.",
      "he has his own style of teaching",
      "Be ready to spend 3 to 4 hours practicing problems every day during the semester, helps a lot in getting a good grade. I advise students to visit him as much as you can during his office hours, really the best during one on one sessions as he will make you easily understand the concept, you will need to make an effort though",
      "Excellent classes!",
      "Graders are pathetic! Professor needs to get good graders.. They make us dislike the class :",
      "good professor",
      "He's a good teacher with a good sense of humor; makes the class interesting and fun",
      "Really good temper and explanations, exams are tough. You'll need to do both homework AND book exercises in order to understand the subject matter. Only exams count for final grade.",
      "The first part of the course is DB design and sql, it's kinda easy if you know this. The second part was really interesting about spatial databases and indexing. HWs are challenging. For the exams you need a lot of reasoning. I just went only once to talk with him and he was helpful, the only bad thing, he didn't talk too much about NOSQL DBs.",
      "Algorithms was a very challenging subject for me as an undergrad, but taking it this time around went so much better for me. Shamsian gave great lectures and explained these difficult concepts very clearly. The class was super challenging for me, but I was able to learn the material and came out with a good grade in the end.",
      "Excellent lecturer. He follows the order of the book topics closely such that what he lectures is paralleled by the assigned book readings.",
      "Shamsian explains complex subjects in Algorithms with crystal clear clarity. Grading was fair, and a total of 3 test (no HW). Interesting to listen to, and very knowledgeable. Complete surprise for an Algorithms professor - one of the best I've had."

      "Lectures are super interesting, hilarious, and very current. There isn't a lot of teaching that specifically ties into the projects at all, so you'll have to teach everything yourself. This class is super hard but super rewarding. I got a job offer listing projects from this class alone. Don't take if you have a weak programming background.",
      "Taken EE542 under him. He speaks a lot about whats happening in the industry. Class are more like a TED talks. At first u feel surprised when u took the course but you will understand the value of this course while hunting for jobs. Professor is multi talented and most respected one. If possible take a DR under him.",
      "We were 15 students in 2017 &amp; almost all of us got through tough interviews just because of the experience with this course. Lectures won't be that informative but need to be attended for pop quizzes which will affect grade. But the project is worth diamonds. It gives valuable experience. You might not be able to finish it but try and code.",

      "Great professor, well-respected professor. You can learn a lot from the labs of the class.",
      "Its a solid course for people looking for a challenge. It takes a great deal of patience and effort to get things to work. Projects are good. Lack of a good TA is a problem. But this course is as close as it gets to real. There are also no firm guidelines on how to achieve the final goal. You are free to put your creativity to max use!! Must take!!",
      "Excellent Class. One of the best I have ever taken at USC. He does not teach much in class, but his idea is to learn more on your own so his homework and projects are challenging. Very Challenging. Time given is less for each project and this keeps you up and running throughout the semester. Do not take if you are lazy or depend on others to work.",
      "Great professor. The workload is very heavy, so keep that in mind before you take the class. However, it is completely worth taking it. THe labs are time consuming yet amazing.",
      "One of the best Systems/Networks graduate level course at USC.",
      "One of the best courses at USC. This course helps you gain a very deep understanding of important Network Protocols. The time crunch keeps you up and running throughout the semester. Stressful in a good way. Most of these projects improve value of your resume.",
      "- The course is mainly about the projects which the professor has very thoughtfully designed to be in line with current and future trends in the industry. The professor gives a lot of real world advice about the kind of technical and non technical skills one must train themselves with for the industry.",
      "One of the best ever class I've attended. He doesn't teach anything on the subject in the class but he only gives the overview of how the industry is in the real world outside. This is what you actually need. No one tells you this for free! Go for this class! Get your assignments done in a couple of days, you can chill for the rest of the week.",
      "Very Though assignments .Lot of scope to learn",
      "Great educator. Motivated to learn and experiment and really let students think. Doesn't spoon feed anything so if looking for set rules and guidelines then people wont find him a \"good teacher\". Really helpful subject. Opens eyes to real world.",
      "Excellent teacher. Hard course and lot of expectations but makes you industry ready",
      "The labs are absolutely worth it, and the classes are more for his life-advice than anything else. Genuinely wants us to do stuff and learn. Loved CARRERit! We should be ready to devote all our time for this one course.",

      "Most sections of this class have reasonable difficulty while one or two topics are extremely hard. Prof. Kempe has a lot of knowledge in algorithms and explains things pretty well. This course is far better than CSCI 270 (which I was supposed to take), but I don't recommend taking it without learning materials from CSCI 270.",
      "One of my favorite professors in USC. The class is hard, and the assignments need a lot of time, so you really need to pay attention in class. Kempe really cares about his students and he explains the concepts really well, though sometimes his progress might be a little bit slower than the other section. I will definitely take his class again.",
      "Kempe is a great teacher and really does his best to explain difficult concepts. Do not be afraid to ask questions during class as there are other kids that probably have the same ones. Be prepared to make 104 a full time job, but that is due to the difficulty of the assignments and not the teaching. Overall a nice guy and good professor.",
      "Genuinely a good guy. He requires all of his students to meet with him at the beginning of the semester so that you can get to know him and vice versa. Definitely cares about his students and the overall department in general. He definitely wants his students to learn. 104 is hard and takes a lot of work. Don't be caught off guard or blame profs.",
      "Awesome professor. He is so passionate and truly cares about his students. He makes a bunch of funny and nerdy jokes, it's great! He is a great professor, and knows a massive amount of the material. The class is NOT EASY. Get ready to work for it. (Totally worth it though)",
      "The course was tough and only serious ones would pass with a descent grade.",
      "Best professor I've had yet. Super friendly, knows everyone's names, and loves his subject. He gives so much homework it is like having a part time job, but you learn SO much. He's very clear and is deep into Computer Science. He is extremely knowledgeable and his assignments are hard but clearly explained.",
      "Really invested in his students. Starts the class off with 1-on-1 interviews, just to get to know your interests. When you listen to him lecturing, you can tell that he absolutely adores CS, which makes it all the more enjoyable to learn from him. Be alert, present, curious, and willing to work your butt off, and you should be fine.",
      "Very clear lectures. PPT slides typically put me to sleep--David's class is more of a conversation + coding examples so it was perfect for my learning style. Assignments can be long but doable in a day or two if you know what you are doing. Expects a lot of his students; but, adds huge curve at the end (75% A).",
      "David was one of the smartest professors I've ever had. He clearly is a computer science guru, but he expects a LOT out of you. 104 is one of the hardest cs classes at sc, but Kempe actually made it do-able (not easy, just do-able). Also, he's really flexible with deadlines and curves, and listens to the class's voice. I got a 50% which was a B-.",
      "Kempe is a great professor. He has a sense of humour and is understanding. He is an empathetic and intelligent professor. His class is extremely challenging but he is one of the best professor's I've ever had.",
      "Class is hard and it is a lot of work, but Kempe is a great lecturer and he will go above and beyond to help you. Also the TAs and \"Sherpas\" are helpful.",
      "Is able to clearly explain the material to students of all levels. Tells (funny) jokes during lectures to lighten the mood. Doesn't subject students to death by PowerPoint. Takes an interest in all of his students. Wish he taught more classes.",
      "David is a good lecturer, however his assignments are just super hard and time consuming that I don't think would help understanding the concepts. Also the exams are nightmares.",
      "Amazing professor. He'll make you work hard on the course. But it'll be totally worth it.",
      "Homework is exceptionally challenging. Fully expect to spend 12+ hours a week on the assignments. Furthermore, tests are quite difficult, with the average on first midterm being a 55% (which still curved to a B) Aside from that, he clearly and concisely explains material, and is very nice and helpful in person.",
      "Outstanding professor, extremely helpful and available. Has high expectations of students, but expectations are fully attainable if students actually think \u2013 you cannot get by in this class by rote memorization.",
      "Good",
      "Great great teacher. Course work was hard, but he spent a lot of time to make sure everyone understood. The first teacher I have had at USC who I thought really cared about me and my education."

      "He is a respectful and caring professor, willing to debug code for students on piazza. However, he assigns way too much homework. There are TWELVE PAs for the class, most of them took me 8 - 10 hours to complete. Thus, this class easily becomes the most demanding class. I also find it hard to understand some of the concepts he presented in lecture",
      "My favorite professor at USC. His class is useful and well-organized. One of the few classes at USC that would prepare you for tech interviews. Easy A if you do all the assignments and review them before exams.",
      "One of the best professors at USC. Clear lectures, reasonable assignments, fair exams, and a humorous teaching style. The course covers many useful aspects of modern C++. Some of the materials are harder, but by doing the assignments you can soon get hold of it. If you pay attention to the lecture well and ace all the assignments, an A is secured.",
      "Sanjay is a great lecturer. Programming assignments could take many hours so plan your time wisely. Tests were a little tough but he curved the final grade. I learned a lot of new C++ concepts that were not covered in CS103/104. Definitely recommended! Also don't cheat on homework. He uses Moss to catch plagiarism.",
      "Sanjay is by far one of the best professors Ive ever had. He was one of the first lecturers who made game programming click, which convinced me to continue pursuing Computer Science (Games). Im very thankful I had his classes. Even as a graduate, when I need to review any concepts, I usually re-read his books.",
      "Very useful class if you want to ace those game programming interviews. Not the most engaging lecturer, but super chill. Goes through material super slowly. First midterm was easy, second midterm was low-key kinda hard, final was in-between. Otherwise, not a class you will stress too much about.",
      "If you've never taken Sanjay's class, don't tell people you study games at USC",
      "Not the most charismatic lecturer, but he does his best to get everyone engaged. He's always accessible if anyone has questions, and has a very well organized class.",
      "The midterm is a little bit tricky but if you listen carefully in the first half of the semester it won't be a problem. Homework only contains 5 labs and they are so easy if you follow instructions in the lab guide. You could use UE4 engine to write your own game as project. Better if you know about linear algebra and C++ programing skills.",
      "Great teacher",

      "Good teacher",
      "Cool, funny guy. Makes class fun and interesting. You do the work, you'll get an A. Exactly what a professor should be.",
      "The nature of Pro C++ is to expose you to different techniques in the C++ language beyond your fundamental data structures. The programming assignments are really well-designed, and Sanjay is just a cool guy. Lectures are long and might put you to sleep, but the slides are really good that it doesn't matter anyway. Exams aren't hard.",
      "Great teacher, explains everything clearly. The class was a very good learning experience, very worthwile.",
      "Decent professor decent class, better than most progeamming classes.",
      "Great professor, clear, easy to understand. Helpful if you ran into a problem. Good teacher overall. But, I feel like the lectures and lab did not contribute as much as I expected. Having previous understanding of the math involved from the CG class, and basic geometry from HS, I didn't learn much new. Labs were following a easy tutorial.",
      "Sanjay's lab assignments are so well designed. The learning curve starts easy but ramps up as class goes on. Paying attention in lecture and studying outside of class is definitely needed for quizzes and midterm.",
      "If you're a games major or interested in games, take Sanjay's ITP380 class ASAP. He teaches you material you need to know for interviews esp in linear algebra for games and programming. Can't give Sanjay higher than a 5 so time to rate him hot.",
      "Sanjay is probably the best professor I've had at USC. He really hit the nail on saying how USC math makes you hate math lol. In fact I found out later on, all of the linear algebra I needed for industry was learned through this class. Take this class very seriously because half the test questions are from interviews.",
      "Awesome teacher, definitely deserving of his 5.0 rating. He should teach other teacher's how to teach.",
      "Sanjay is THE game programing professor at USC. His lectures are informative and he occasionally tells an anecdote from industry. His labs are well designed to build up the skills a game programmer needs.",
      "Sanjay is a great professor who really helps you learn. His classes aren't tough to do well in but I learned more from him than any other professor at USC. He's really good at presenting material in a way that makes you interested in it and he gives you tons of resources to do well. He's also extremely accessible and helpful.",
      "He's silly, comedic, and useful.",
      "Sanjay is a great teacher and I think he is changing USC's games program for the better. It took me a while to figure him out, but now that I have, I have a ton of respect for him. Talk to him, listen to him, and realize that he is a nerd just like you and me - but a very knowledgeable. You won't find a better professor in the program.",
      "Sanjay is an awesome professor .. His lectures can get boring, but still, pay attention because he gives you info you'll need for the test. The projects are fun and he is very insightful whenever you need help.",
      "Sanjay provides insight into the wonderful world of game programming. His lectures are almost poetic in nature. Sanjay's delivery is most appealing. Unfortunately his teaching skill does not translate to SC2. He sucks at that."

      "She is actually the best professor at USC, you should definitely sign up for her class! She is 100000x better than any ITP professor. She is super understanding and can help you out if you mess up or need any help. She will always try to give u as much credit as possible for doing something. I can go on and on but seriously just take her class!",
      "She is great! Got to this class late and she made sure to get me new deadlines so I could turn in all of my homework and offered to change it again if it still proved to be too much! Her lectures and slides are clear and the labs and hw are very doable. I would take this class again!",
      "Really enthusiastic and energetic. She seemed to actually thoroughly enjoy the topic she taught which made the lectures fun and interesting.",
      "Amazing professor, amazing class. Get her for any class she teaches.",
      "Great Class",
      "She's an amazing lecturer. Most professors lack the basic skills required to keep students engaged, but Paulina has mastered them all.",
      "Each class is a 40 minute lecture followed by a lab on the lecture material that's due at the end of class. Labs are worth 20% so you not only have to show up but also pay attention to all lectures. But Paulina is such a cheerful person that it's hard not to pay attention. Homework is assigned every week, and there's 1 midterm and 1 final.",
      "She really sucks. She really sucks in that she's not teaching any of the upper division programming classes at the time of this writing. I'm really going to miss being taught by her. If I can give her a letter grade I would give her an A+.",
      "Prioritize getting this woman as your professor for any programming class she teaches. She's the very definition of what a spectacular professor is. She needs to be rewarded for her performance. If you're reading this Paulina, thank you and know that I highly respect you. Please continue to teach new students in your wonderful ways :)",
      "She is great! The content is very clear and the class is easy according to your affinity with computer science. She obviously loves what she does and is extremely excited to teach. She also encourages you to fight for your grade. If you think you deserve a better grade, just talk to her about it. There is a lab due at the end of class so DO show up",
      "Two thumbs up for this professor. Never had I seen a professor so passionate and excited to teach the material.",
      "Low key, I think she came down from heaven to breathe life into the computer science classes. L-O-V-E-D HER and her quirky, cheerful personality.",
      "Excellent! She is so nice!",
      "Oh my god, I LOVED Paulina. Easily my top pick for the best lecturer at SC. She's hilarious, a lenient grader, and does her best to explain programming concepts. Though if you have zero programming experience, you still have to put in the work in this class to get an A as the course does move fast despite being a 2 unit class.",
      "Best professor I've ever had. Makes tough programming concepts super easy to understand and is always willing to go above and beyond to help anyone out. Amazing class!!",
      "I'm so glad I had her for this class. She's very approachable, witty, and made the class enjoyable for everyone. She's up there as one of my favorite teachers ato USC. You won't regret being taught by her.",
      "She's so energetic that you'll have a hard time falling asleep or daydream in this class. She lectures the 1st half of the class and assigns a short lab right after that's due at the end of class--if you finish early you can leave. Homework is assigned once a week and isn't all that bad, same goes for the midterm and final. Loved this class.",
      "Each class period is a 30 to 40min lecture, followed by a lab that's due at the end of class. You're supposed to get a 0 if you don't finish, but she often extended it till the next class if people didn't finish. The rater below me probably made some error for weekly homework; it takes you 2 to 4 hours, not 13. Paulina is fun and lively. Loved it.",
      "-While CS lectures are boring in nature, she adds her own flair to make it fun. -In-class labs are assigned and due by end of class, but if a significant portion of the class don't finish it, she extends the due date. -Weekly CS homework takes 13hrs. -Just 1 Midterm and 1 Final. -Extremely helpful & funny. Highly recommended."

      "Nathan is the best! ISE 150 is very fast-paced and very challenging with tons of homework. But nathan makes it bearable by being entertaining in lecture and very accessible outside of class. 1 midterm 1 final, he is very straightforward about his expectations on these exams. Go to class and get help and you can get a B for sure.",
      "Attendance not required but GO. Nathan has thorough lectures explaining all concepts very well and stops for questions frequently. He cares about his students and how they are doing and is often available for help - he wants students to succeed and get a good grade. Confused? Go to office hours - you'll understand concepts/code better.",
      "Amazing guy. Amazing professor. Super big heart, explains the toughest CS concepts clearly, is available outside of class and is a fair grader. As far as data structures/algorithms classes go, this is as easy as it could be. Grade mostly based on HW, and exams are no big surprise.",
      "Nathan is one of the best professors. He is always available outside of class. His lectures, labs, &amp; HWs are clear. He even sometimes does the labs with you. He is so funny and down to earth and really cares that you do well in the class. He puts a lot of emphasis on the HWs and the labs, which makes the MT &amp; final less intimidating. TAKE HIM!!!!!!",
      "100/10 would take Nathan's class again! Absolutely loved learning python from him and will definitely take any class of his in the future. I had trouble in between and would go to his office hours on Friday and sit with him for up to 4 hours. He was always willing to help and it was a pleasure being in his class!",
      "best! he is a bomb teacher! very very very helpful and accommodating! cracks stupid jokes which lightens the atmosphere of the class. go to office hours as that will make your life much easier. can't emphasis enough how much happier you'll be taking his class over any other professors. also, extremely knowledgable about the ITP program in general.",
      "Nathan is awesome-- definitely take a class with him if you have the chance! Overall this class was pretty standard for ITP, you have homeworks due every other week and weekly labs. Nathan usually lectures for half of class then allots time to work on homework-- I recommend sticking around during this time for help. Biggest advice: start HW early",
      "Greenfield is a good guy. As an objective teacher, he is incredible at explaining concepts. His dumb jokes are always welcome during a stressful day. The class itself is one of my favorites ever. The written tests SUCK though and are terrible at judging one's ability. His biggest fault is he rarely admits when he doesn't know something.",
      "AMAZING PROFESSOR! Is more than willing to meet with you in office hours or even one on one, and genuinely wants everyone in the class to understand programming. Definitely do go to his office hours, as they are incredibly helpful. His jokes are corny but funny, and he really tries to relate to the students. I can't recommend Nathan enough!!!",
      "Awesome professor, makes reference jokes, lectures are clear and well organized. Nathan is also very helpful during office hours, DO GO TO THEM as I wouldn't have finished my homeworks otherwise. Overall great course, great professor.",
      "Funny guy, sometimes a little corny. But he knows his stuff in C++ and is super nice and helpful at office hours and open lab hours. There are always a ton of people asking for help in lab hours though, so you might not get his help right away. Free pizza in lab hours, at least in my semester (Spring 2016). Final brought me down from an A tho :'(",
      "Amazing professor, amazing class. Content moves pretty quickly, but the labs are very helpful in reinforcing previous content. Go to office hours for help on homework. Exams are pretty straightforward, skim through the lectures again and look at the homework/labs. Show up for class, labs aren't worth that much but you don't learn otherwise.",
      "It was my first time programming so it wasn't the easiest class, but Nathan definitely made the class fun!",
      "He has so many office hours and he's a very patient professor. His slides and the material he presents is really organized.",
      "Greenfield is good. You don't need the book to do well in the class. His exams were not that difficult if you studied and did the homework. Make sure to do well on the group projects and you should do well overall. His lectures end early and you get candy if you go to office hours.",
      "Nathan is great. Willing to work with you during office hours, and is readily accessible by email. The class is difficult, especially because it's a 2-unit class and especially if you haven't had prior experience with C++, but he makes it really enjoyable.",
      "He's a funny guy. Willing to help with labs very well during office hours. Would recommend. Unlike ITP165, there's no lab after lecture, so you don't need to go to every class as the lecture slides are online. Homework is assigned every two weeks compared to every week from ITP165, but they're much longer and harder so be prepared.",
      "Nathan is a very funny guy. You enjoy every moment of this class. There is a lab every session so be prepared."

The assignments, both programming and theory will be well graded and detailed. You will learn to program ML algos from scratch. Discussions are the best he makes sure you participate.",
      "A person with clear ideas about machine learning and what he is teaching with a few jokes in between his lectures.",
      "Good professor. Caring students. Although language is a problem. But I will rate 5. Worth it.",
      "He's a great professor. Initially maybe one might feel difficulty in understanding his accent(which is not too hard as well). But other than that, undoubtedly amazing lectures. We learn to think and how to approach a problem in a different way. I just love his lectures! Given a chance just take the course !!!!",

      "Victor is awesome! His lecture is logical and inspiring. His slides are well-prepared. The examples of the algorithms application are different from the textbook. So I have to read both his slides and the textbook. Though his Russian accent made me confused at first several lectures. But I have been used to it and found him a good professor.",
      "Pro Adamchik has an accent so it may be difficult for some students to hear or understand. But if you try to listen carefully, you will find Pro Adamchik teaches well. He not only focus on content in books but also adds some extends in lecture. His lectures are clear and logical."

This class will teach you self-motivation and show you that even non-technical students can be technical.",

      "One of my favorite CS professors at USC. It's a shame he left to do Software Engineering for Google - USC misses him! In case he does teach again in the future and you have an opportunity to take his class, do it! He communicates information in a clear and helpful way that is up-to-date with industry standard.",
      "He is always willing to give feedback and help you no matter how busy he is.",
      "He is a very great teacher. He is willing to put in time for one-on-one help. He dresses casually to class- does not mind when people do not show up or come lateleave early. I came in the class with 0 knowledge on programming but ending up passing with a B after attending many office hour sessions.",
      "Amazing professor!! I've never had a professor so available and helpful. And for helping you debugging your code, he is impressive. You may have spent hours on your code but he gets what you typed right away. Excellent professor!",
      "He is pretty clear in what he explains. His notes are the best, just go through them carefully before exams and you might get an A. You will never touch the textbook. Really good professor, totally recommended. Incredibly helpful, sometimes he has like 10 students in his office and he manages to help them all. You will end up loving cats.",
      "Prof Pritchard was one of the best professors I've had at USC so far. He is an extremely approachable, quirky guy, who loves to tell jokes about Canada and cats. He always makes himself available in office hours and even within class has developed an interactive \"notes and exercises\" page for every lecture and walks around the class to help.",
      "Pretty difficult if you don't have prior experience with coding. However, Professor Pritchard's helpfulness makes up for this. He is always willing to help, no matter how swamped office hours are. Never made me feel dumb for asking questions about basic concepts. Go to office hours and schedule appointments!",
      "If you are new to coding or to computer science over all be prepared to put in a good amount of effort to pass. Pritchard makes it easy to learn, specially if you have a good knowledge of C and C++. Lectures go by slow and your grade mainly depends on 5 big coding assignments you have to turn in that are not very hard if you know your stuff.",
      "If you know C and C++ well, you won't really need to attend class too much; nonetheless, you'll want to go because Pritchard's lectures are really interesting and go beyond just learning basic programming. Furthermore, he's also an extremely humble and intelligent guy. If you're taking CS 103, make sure to take it with either Pritchard or Redekopp.",
      "Best looking male in the CS department. Class grade average is superior within CS-103, lecture very clear and no accent."

      "One of the best CSE professors, show comics at the beginning of every lecture. Though PAs are tough, you could learn a lot.",
      "Rick is a good professor. However CSE 30 has a ridiculous workload. It assumes that you only need to take this one course for the quarter. I need to spend like 2-3 whole days for the PAs every week, and this makes my life extremely unbalanced. The grading of those PAs are also strict, you can lose lots of points for minor errors.",
      "Rick's last year at UCSD and he is very straightforward in explaining concepts. His PAs are hard though I can still handle them. I would say if you want to learn something, take his class.",
      "Good lecturer. He really knows his stuff and is helpful, but programming assignments are a lot of work.",
      "I really enjoyed Rick's classes! He is responsible, hilarious, and always patient to answer any question from the students. Lots of homework, but also lots of extra credit. His programming assignments and quizzes do make me learn a lot. Would definitely take his class again!",
      "Class put me to sleep sometime but he really knows his stuff. Assessments were basically the same as what he posts online on his class webpage, so study those. Start early start often",
      "Rick teaches a lot of new materials during one lecture, so pay attention to every detail and ask questions immediately when lost. Just follow what Rick requires, try hard, and you will definitely get an A because he gives tons of extra credits during midterm and final for you to make up the points you lose on quiz and PA. Love him a lot^^",
      "Programming assignments are challenging but quizzes and exams are okay if u do exams and quizzes in previous quarter. His lecture and lecture notes are pretty good for learning.",
      "This class requires a lot of time and effort but Just learned so much and i purely think how much you put it in this class will determine your grade in the end. There are tons of practice midterm, quiz, finals on his website so there are really no excuse . Lastly the tutors are just awesome they are really knowledgeable. Start early start often",
      "The great (lower division) prof. There is EXTRA CREDIT in the homework assignments. PLEASE GO TO LECTURES. You can still pass the course if you miss classes, but why miss classes when you are able to learn the things you need for the course as well as for the future? The lectures are useful and humourous. There is NO GRADE PULL-UPS OR CURVES.",
      "Though difficult, most people can get an A through numerous extra credit from exams and assignments. Rick will give out previous exams for practice. His class will also get you prepared for more CSE courses.",
      "This class is notoriously hard, but he makes it seems pretty easy since he gives you like 10 years of previous exams with same format as tests, so test/quizzes are pretty easy. Just be sure to also study his notes, because he adds extra stuff not on previous exams in recent years; missed a lot of points bc I only did practice exam & got 89% :((((((",
      "The materials are not very hard for this class, and the exams are also fair to be honest, but you have to be very careful during the exam, since it's all about calculations. The first two PAs are easy, but the third PA is extremely hard!!! I spent my whole weekend and also skipped two days of classes but still didn't finish it.",
      "His classes are tough because he assigns a lot of PA (programming assignments) and quizzes. But if you really want to learn at a fast pace, he is a good professor. His assignment aren't hard but rather time consuming (think 10-15 hours a week if you're decently fast). Good thing: don't buy the book, the pdf is out there and I haven' used it anyways",
      "Rick is an excellent professor that cares about his students. His policy on programming assignments is very strict, but it's definitely worth what you will learn in his class.",
      "For anyone who has had some (you don't need to be the creator of java) programming experience, Rick does an amazing job of solidifying OOP concepts. His PAs (programming assignments) also pack a punch and will take a good chunk of your time, but as you'll hear often in this class, \"start early, start often\". Also, make use of his practice exams!",
      "One of the best! CSE11 requires students with programming background. It does not mean one semester with Python. You'd better have taken something like C/C++/java. If you do, you will find this course very helpful in many ways. HW is tough, but everything is VERY REASONABLE. Previous exams help a lot. You will learn a lot from him and won't forget.",
      "His lectures are ok. It covers a lot in a somewhat tedious and separated way. It's pretty informative if you're already good at programming, but, I guess, will be unreasonably hard for those who are not. Homework is terrible but it will test your will to be a programmer. Not the most respectful person you see in the world.",
      "The class itself isn't very hard, however there is A LOT of homework; the programming assignments are usually long and tedious and you can easily lose points along the way on stupid stuff. However, I did find some of them to be pretty fun to do. Tests and quizzes are pretty easy. Just study all of the previous exams and you'll do fine.",
      "Honestly, the hottest professor in the CSE department. Real Legend.",
      "Ord is a great professor who genuinely cares about his students. That said, CSE11 felt like a waste of time. The PA's take a long time to do simply because of how long it takes to parse through their long instructions and constraints, and the tests only contained a few questions on lecture material. On the plus side, he posts all old exams.",
      "Professor Ord was pretty good. His lectures can be a bit boring, and his jokes are either a hit or miss, but he attempts to make them interesting for an 8am class. There's weekly programming assignments that take a lot of time to do. But there's also tons of extra credit, and tons of tutors to help. As long as you don't procrastinate you'll ace it.",
      "He gives very clear lectures and wonderful handouts. The programming assignments are interesting. There are about 10% people got A+ in FA16 quarter. and about half received an A.",
      "He is amazing professor that show care to all his students. He is kind of humorous and really like to tell jokes in the class. He is middle- level lecturer, you may understand most of his lecture, but you may still need assistance from piazza. Even though there is no curve, You are very likely to get A or at least A- .",
      "Rick Ord is definitely a great professor. He goes very quick in lecture because there are a lot of materials to cover. His handouts are helpful. Getting an A is pretty easy in this class (over half people get A's). Make sure to \"Start Early, Start Often\" and pay attention to details for the PAs. Tests are somewhat tricky but he gives previous tests",
      "This review is for those didn't take AP CS/took a CS class but forgot nearly everything. I took CS8A and dropped CS8B my 1st year. Now for my 3rd year, I decided I would take CS11 because I didn't think I could do CS8B. CS11 was so difficult and was the bane of my existence every week. Be ready to do a lot of work on those PA's. Tests are okay.",
      "Tip for lecture-missers: If you don't attend lectures, at least make it for the beginning so you can get a handout (they are notes from the textbook that explain everything) I missed the midterm because my phone died overnight so my alarm didnt go off and I emailed Rick in panic but he gave me a percentage of my final grade as my midterm score!",
      "\"Start early, start often\" \"Think like a compiler; act like a run time environment\" Rick Ord 's lecture can be interesting; but his assignments are absolutely long but interesting and even inspiring.",
      "Prof Ord is really clear on grading criteria and gives solid interesting lectures. But CSE11 indeed is an accelerated class so he moves across his materials at a really fast pace (you really cannot afford to blank out in class), get ready to code and it's super important to stay self-efficient in this class with the resources provided.",
      "He's a great teacher who knows his curriculum very well. Mr. Ord's been teaching for many years and as a result, he knows exactly how to explain things so that you'll understand him. Take his class if you can!!!!!",
      "I'm not a great student, and I could have definitely tried harder in his class to get a good grade, but I learned a ton and I got a great fundamental understanding of Java. He's a little pompous, but who cares? He can back it up. And besides, eventually you're going to have to deal with someone whose personality you don't like. I had no problems.",
      "PA could be really long and took a lot of time.. Make a good use of previous quizzes and exams.. The class overall was not that hard.. Learned a lot from each PA",
      "He's an ok lecturer, sometime he goes too fast. His midterms and finals are really long, however he give you his old exams to practice which are really helpful. Hmmn.. I think he's a bit overrated it.",
      "Awesome lecturer. Although he went too fast sometimes, but he made the points crystal clear. PAs are fair, just remember to start early and start often. Do practice quizes/midterms/finals and you will be on the right track to get an at least an A.",
      "love him!!!! TAKE HIM I PROMISE YOU WILL LOVE HIM TOO. Not only is he super duper smart, HE KNOWS HOW TO TEACH. He tells you the background information of what is going on in java that other professors don't usually go over. Book is needed to reiterate over some concepts, but if you go over the notes that he provides, you'll be fine.",
      "Good professor! His lecture is very interesting. Exam is similar to practice exam.",
      "I came in with zero programming experience except for a small Java class in high school. Surrounded by many AP and beyond students, it was quite intimidating. Nonetheless, I put in about 10-12 hours a week on the hardest PAs and maybe around 5 for the easier ones. I really recommend him if you know you have the drive.",
      "Lectures are super clear. I came in with APCS knowledge but goofed around all quarter until the final. Aced that and got the A. Lots of extra credit opportunities in labs and exams. Attended may be half the classes. DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK, his notes cover everything you ever need to know.",
      "Great teacher, great class. the programming assignments are long but fun if you start early. Sometimes his lectures can be very long but definitely recommend going. He definitely has his stuff together",
      "He is a great professor. He makes concepts extremely easy to understand. Programming assignments are simple. Previous quizzes and midterms are given and are almost the same as the real tests. He is so far the best professor I have ever met. Don't need textbooks if you have programming background except for one PA. Really easy to get A+.",
      "PA's can sometimes be long, expect 7-8 hours per week on some longer projects. Quizzes are extremely easy, and so are the midterms. Do not really NEED to go to lecture, but it is definitely recommended. No need to buy the textbook.",
      "You have to earn the grade, but he gives you all the resources to do so. Great professor, great class, even if it is difficult.",
      "Great professor! The practice exams are exactly the same as your exams, and you are given the last ten years of exams. Very simply to do very well on exams given all this practive! Expect a lot of homework. The assignments are long, some enjoyable, others just a pain to complete. Definitely recommend Rick!",
      "Rick is simply brilliant! His lectures keep you so engaged and you can feel yourself learning. I had no Java experience prior to this class, but Rick made everything clear and I ended up becoming pretty experienced in Java by the end of the class. His quizzes and exams are very straightforward. Homework is time consuming, but make use of tutors!",
      "I enjoyed Ord's CSE 11 class very much. The guy is clear on everything, and all of the assignments are just fun to do. He provides all of his past exams and quizzes to study from, and they reflect what you'll be seeing on them in class. Just a great experience overall.",
      "Truly a great professor. I heard a bit about Ord before taking this class so I was stoked when I got him for CSE30. Never missed a lecture and never wanted to. Some concepts are tricky, but Ord magically simplifies it to make it easy to grasp. I will miss being in this class and hope to cross paths with him again someday.",
      "By far my favorite professor and class at UCSD. Ord has a clear passion for both the subject and his students' learning. His lectures are very easy to follow, and the way he explains concepts makes them really easy to understand. The class uses clickers, but you'll want to show up for this class anyway.",
      "At all cost take this professor. His connection toward the students is very strong and improves your passion toward CS. Highly recommended for it is not often I find great professors like him. His lectures are meant to \"supplement\" the readings from the books but his enthusiasm in lecture makes learning better than reading the book.",
      "Writing down notes onto the slides he gives out really helps, otherwise you're going to have a bad time.",
      "Lecture note handouts are super helpful. Programming assignments are long, but there are only 4 per quarter (there are checkpointsmilestones, however). The writeups for the PAs are detailed but leave out the specific implementation details, so you have to think for yourself a bit. Quizzes and exams are straightforward (look at past years'!)",
      "Rick is a great professor. There are practice quizzes, midterms and finals on his website that are nearly identical to the real things. You will spend a lot of times in the lab on the assignments. Easy to get an A, but it's very time consuming.",
      "He is a really good professor if you pay attention to his lectures, answers questions well. You definitely need a study group to get through this class.",
      "Great lecturer. Makes things crystal clear. Genuinely seems to care about students success in the classroom as well as in the field. He's straightforward about what will be on his tests and final, and they are very fair. He's very helpful and involved with his students as well - communicating is easy with Ord. Overall great professor!",
      "Best Professor I've had at UCSD. He goes over every concept in detail, even trivial topics to make sure you understand what's going on. The homework is very time consuming and at times very difficult, but the tests are very fair if you've been paying attention.",
      "I took Ord fall 2013. This guy is the best CS professor that is out there! While he can talk a bit too fast at times, especially when he is talking about SPARC stack frames, this guy is just the best professor at explaining things. The class is definitely a LOT of work, but if you are a dedicated person and do all of your work you will do great!",
      "One of the best teachers at UCSD. Class is just not easy.",
      "Best professor at UCSD. At least the best computer science professor you'll ever have, so enjoy it while it lasts! :)",
      "Rick is awesome. Definitely my favorite class this quarter. The programming assignments were very fun. It was my first time taking a programming class, was hard at first, at the end things were easy.",
      "Rick knows his stuff and he will gladly do everything he can to make sure you understand if you are willing enough to be bold and ask. He is very fair, but he expects you to work hard. You might need some confidence to ask him questions though, he definitely takes pride in explaining everything as clear as he can.",
      "Ord is a great teacher. He really knows the material. The notes he provides are exceptional and good to hold on to for future references. Overall, I thought his projects reflected what we were learning and were very helpful.",
      "Very good at explaining the concepts. Tests are fair and I should have got an A+ if it wasn't for a brain shutdown on on the midterm. Will def. sign up for future classes with Rick.",
      "Lectures can be boring at times, but the note handouts are well worth going for. Easy tests/quizzes if you just review the notes and use common sense. Programming assignments usually straightforward but were tricky at times...get started early!",
      "Really easy professor. I think the class average was like a B+ with most people getting an A on the final. Lectures may be boring, but he's really easy to understand if you actually listen. Lectures are not necessary, but you might want a friend who goes to lectures since he puts those \"favorite coffee\" types of questions on the test.",
      "Fair Grading. Ord is helpful. Attend lectures and labs. Textbook needed if you have no previous experience in programming.",
      "Quizzes/midterms/final are really easy if you study the past tests that he provides online. Programming assignments can be challenging unless you get lucky and get a genius partner.",
      "If you've taken a class with him before, you pretty much know how the class is going to go. Quizzes and exams are almost exactly like the practice/previous ones he has listed on his website, and the programming assignments were pretty fair (just make sure you start SUPER early!)",
      "He is a fairly lenient teacher and the class average what somewhere around B+. The exams are fairly easy though the only hard part of his class would be the programming assignments though with proper help from TAs it shouldn't be much of a problem if you do it in advance.",
      "I wish there was a University of California, Rick Ord.",
      "Awesome teacher, really easy to follow lectures, tests are relatively easy and doable, esp. with allowed cheatsheets. Probably the only professor that makes you love programming much, as he is passionate about the subject himself. TAKE HIM!",
      "Brilliant professor, I learned so much in 15L. The thing that always surprises me about Ord is how much you learn, and how knowledgeable he is. Can answer any and all questions totally throughly, and all assignments and exams are really tailored well towards learning what's important.",
      "Came in with no prior introduction to programming. Learned cool new stuff. It was an morning class, but his lecture was interesting enough that i remembered most of the things he said and passed the extremely easy tests. All that i needed to pass the test were pen, basic knowledge of java programming, coffee, and rationality.",
      "Start the 2nd project as soon as the specification is out (typically a lot of people got killed because of this). Because of the 2nd project, this class is basically converted into another extremely BS assembly class like CSE30. Ord however is a very good lecturer and really cares about how his students learn.",
      "great professor! everything is very straightforward. definitely made me even more excited to be a CS major!",
      "Take as many classes with him as possible. His lectures are very clear and easy to understand, yet the homeworks challenge you enough to understand the concepts even more. I find it very surprising that despite how great of a prof he is, less than half of the students come to lectures regularly. He makes you understand everything very well.",
      "Awesome teacher. Very fair with his grading but you have to read all his extremely helpful handouts and do the practice midterms and quizzes he has on his website. The programming assignments are not easy but if you start EARLY and go to discussion you should be fine.",
      "Honestly one of the few good CSE teachers at UCSD. If you see any of his classes offered and you have a requirement that he fulfills. Take his class. Fair, concise, no tricks, teaches coherent understandable material. No politics and no bullsh*t. Great teacher. You'll be hard pressed to find better at the sh*t factory that UCSD is.",
      "Compared to 8A last quarter, I felt as though he actually taught material a lot better. Quizzes were fairly simple if you read the topics he tells you to look up. Programming assignments are pretty challenging. Midterm and final were simple. Overall, pretty good class. Thumbs up for Rick Ord!.... and a huuzah as well.",
      "He makes it easy for us (thank god, it was a slight break from CSE 30). Long story short, only 10 people didn't get A's on the final. 'Nuff said.",
      "Good god could they make this class any easier&#63;!! He's a cool prof I guess, but if you're familiar with computers...this class is a joke, a stupid 6th college ge...you'd better get an A. Rarely went to class, always went to lab, got an A. Used the textbook maybe once or twice, borrow or share with a friend don't buy it...",
      "This is my first programming class and let me start off by saying that Rick Ord is probably the most engaging and passionate teacher I have ever had. Very clear lectures, and If you notice that he repeats what he says alot to make sure that everyone understands. The quizes and exams are tricky...Pay close attention. Ord is the more caring professor",
      "Professor is pretty eh. A bit stubborn and selfish. Lectures are very random too; all you is look at code and figure out what it does. Quizzes are specific, no way to prepare for them besides knowing everything about CS. Class is supposed to assume no prior knowledge of CS, but he teaches as if you already have prior knowledge of the material.",
      "He's the best!!! Over 80% of the class got 90%+ on the final! The lowest was 77%. His notes are the most useful thing ever! He even add stuff that are not in the book, which will most likely appear on the quiz. The quizzes are also very helpful, since they WILL prepare you for the midterm/final!!!",
      "this class will probably make you a good CS student if you can find a way to stay interested in the material. if not it'll feel like you're beating your head against the wall for 10 weeks. pass the advil please&#63; book is useless, because prof teaches different stuff. also, it's nice that he prints notes for us, but it'd be better if he posted them.",
      "Its really easy, but you will learn a lot of things form his class!!!!",
      "He's probably the best teacher I've ever had. He really engages you in the material and has a passion for teaching. His lectures go beyond the surface level and he explains things in a way that is easier to understand.",
      "Great teacher! Easy to take notes in class. Tests are straight forward.",
      "You can tell he really knows what he's doing, and he wants you to understand as well. Didn't study and got a B+. The lab's are a pain sometimes, but I think they're working out the kinks. Anyways, take him if you have to take this class!",
      "real easy class, yet i slacked off. He's a funny teacher, makes things understandable. dont buy the textbook. go to class, boring at times but he gives out funny extra credit answers for the quiz :]",
      "Funny guy. I learned a lot from him.",
      "Really easy class, but attending lecture is highly recommended because he puts random fact questions on quizzes from class. but even if you do horrible on quizzes, the labs really operate as a grade booster. midterm 1 page front as cheat sheet, final 1 page front/back as cheat sheet.",
      "Great prof, very clear, occasionally funny, nice...really easy class. Don't need to buy the textbook, notes are online..just have to listen in lecture for little facts that aren't in the notes for the quizzes and tests. Very straightforward labs.",
      "very easy. lectures can get boring sometimes.",
      "Definitely one of the best, if not THE best, CSE professors in UCSD. He has very clear lectures, easy quizzes to study for (the questions on the quizzes are very straight forward and they can be very prepared by reading the book and his lecture notes), and he is a very funny and entertaining professor. If you don't take Rick, you're missing out.",
      "Best cs prof I had so far. Lectures are crucial, since the materials are somewhat difficult but Ord explains them very clearly. No curve, uses a lot of questions from the past quizzes and exams. Start at least 5 days before program assignment is due, since they take from 15~20+ hours to complete. Keep on track and it'll be a breeze!",
      "Professor Ord is amazing. He loves to tell jokes and stray away from the material but there's nothing to lose! The material was easy. I never used the bookg so purchasing is not needed. Go to lecture, Go to lab and you'll be fine!",
      "Absolutely great professor. Gives excellent notes and goes through them thoroughly, making a lot of material a breeze. Posts past quizzes and finals. The only thing difficult about 30 is the programming assignments, and they aren't too bad; they just take a LOT of time, which is bad if you're busy. Start early on programming and you have an easy A.",
      "If you fail this class, you fail at life. This class is so easy it's ridiculous. He's a really nice guy, but he's really annoying too cause he tries to be funny, and fails, hard. If you understand all of the material, don't bother with lecture, but if you don't, go.",
      "Ord is a super nice, friendly, and easy-to-understand teacher. Try to go to lectures because they really are helpful and it's easy to get in the habit of skipping them. Labs are a piece of cake. Cheat sheets allowed! In the beginning of class he told us that if we didn't get an A, we probably missed a test and never went.",
      "Ord is a great professor and a really cool, average joe type of guy. He really tries hard to teach you stuff that you will actually be able to use regardless of your major and he does a good job of it. The lab was fun and interesting too. It would be silly to take this class with anyone else.",
      "Easy for the most part. You should attend lectures but not really mandatory for you to pass. Labs are 40% and very easy - the TAs pretty much walk you through them each week.",
      "Ord is awesome! Everyone should take him for CSE!! He's really funny and helpful and the class is really easy. All you have to do is show up to labs and you'll get an A!",
      "Easy class as long as you attend labs and take the quizzes. Class itself is really boring but go because he gives you answers to quizzes.",
      "Very easy class, just make sure to attend lectures. he goes over everything that will be on quizzes and allows a cheat sheet for midterm and final. Labs are worth 40% of grade and they're SO easy. Great prof, easy class.",
      "He's totally awesome and fun to have. He makes the class fun and wants the students to excel. Take him if you get the chance.",
      "Excellent professor. Take him whenever possible! He posts lots of his old quizzes and tests online. Not much bad I can say about him except that when I took his class, he was reformulating the curriculum a little and the new parts of the programming assignments were confusing. He probably has it straightened out by now.",
      "The best teacher I have seen in CS at UCSD. He is excellent at clarifying difficult issues and REALLY cares about his students. That is so important, and most teachers are not like that. He really is awesome. I'm glad he is the compilers teacher (CSE 131). The only negative thing about the class is the notes might get a little convoluted, be neat.",
      "The coolest cse prof you'll ever have. Great sense of humor, down to earth and very good at teaching. Strong command of material. Knows how to deliver material that could easily be very bland a dry otherwise. Quizzes are a bit rushed, but all his old quizzes are posted on website so you know what he will ask. I highly recommend him!",
      "This class is easy. Go to class because he goes over everything that shows up on the quizzes. Exams are easy, he let's you have a cheat sheet, and deinitely study the previous quizzes and exams. Labs are definitely a grade booster. This class is an easy A. He's pretty nice and chill too. I'd definitely recommend. Book helps to clarify, not necessar",
      "Ord is the man. If you can ever take a class with this guy do it. Unlike other professors who believe you learn best through failing grades and ridiculous quizzes and exams, Ord simply teaches the material really well and gives fair exams.",
      "His class= easy+useful+relax :P go take his class even though it's not an requirement for ur major or college",
      "This instructor is the best CS teacher I have ever had. His lectures are very clear. His grading is somewhat easy ( I expected an 91% on my final but I got 98%). He provides you with a lot of sample exams (so there are no surprises). GOLDEN ADVICE: practice the sample exams before you go take the exam, and ur A is guaranteed!",
      "the class in general is easy, this prof makes it even easier. He's funny and really nice though sometimes it feels like he's wasting your time. Has an affinity for the pub too. Other than that, really fair about quizzes and exams.",
      "Amazingly wonderful prof. A welcome breath of fresh air after 12. Go to class and pay attention, you'll learn what you need- as well as be entertained by his tangents. Fair grading. All previous quizzes/exams linked to site. Easy to get extra credit. Just make sure to start early on the projects, the labs tend to be too full near the due date.",
      "Makes an excruciating class somewhat tolerable. Demonstrates exuberance and excitement about his field that is lacking in other CS professors. Has good rapport with students. Very difficult programming assignments, but they are tolerable knowing that the professor seems genuinely interested in teaching and not just destroying your soul for sport.",
      "Unlike CSE 12 with Gillespie, you spend more energy learning and less energy ripping your hair out. His quizzes, midterm and final are extremely similar to the ones from previous quarters, so it's really easy to get your grade. But don't take this for granted and ignore the class because there is a**** LOAD to learn here: the material learned WILL show up in job interviews and future classes.",
      "Great class, programming assignments took time, but weren't insane like cse12. Tests were actually reflective of the material. Funny guy with an actual personality.",
      "i think i went to lecture twice this quarter... i got a B ... i am not a computer person, enough said&#63;",
      "I thought this class was going to be an easy A but I spent so much time trying to get it this class was frustrating! Lectures were really boring sometimes too. Nice professor though, REALLY nice, gives prizes in class and is relaxed and funny too, unlike me...",
      "He is a very nice guy who trys to make class fun with comics. He puts his lecture slides online and spends class time on other stuff so he doesn't have much time for lecture. An easy class and you can definitely pass without going, but a lot of the stuff he talks about in class that isn't online shows up on the test. Tests are easy enough.",
      "No Comments",
      "Awesome prof... definitely worthwhile to take. 420 baby!!! Anyone thats taken him, you know what i'm talkin' about.",
      "I really like this pro. The major credit is after the midterm. So if you mess up the midterm, don't worry, just work harder, you will be ok.",
      "No Comments",
      "Of all the CS professors on campus, this is the only one that rocks. He'll ask you what questions you want on the midterm, then read them out to the class, providing feedback as to whether they should be on there or not. Compilers class sucks... but this",
      "Ord is definitely one of the best CSE professors. His teaching style actually helps you learn and understand the material, while remaining interested. Programs do take a lot of time, but you will know your material inside and out by the end of the quarter.",
      "If you're a CS major looking for relief after Gillespie, Rick's your man. Although the programs may be a bit tedious, the knowledge you gain and the way he presents the information are intriguing. You'll come out having learned much more than you did in CSE 12.",
      "Good proffessor, learned a lot. Don't buy the book. His course notes suffice.",
      "If the quarter you're taking it hasn't started yet, I really recommend you going to the website (ieng9.ucsd.edu/~cs30x) and download all the past quizzes/exams NOW. no links to them once the quarter starts. Easy class, there are readings but you don't have to do them, save money don't buy the book.",
      "His reputation preceeds him... What are you doing reading this, take his class now!!!",
      "He is a good professor....apparently one of the nest in the CSE deptt...he is a cool guy and likes his students to learn a great deal in this class....but 1 caution,dont go for extra credit in his class.....for 1 point of credit,you will have to work a lot....but otherwise he is a great guy....",
      "No Comments",
      "Easy for you to learn n not feel sleepy",
      "a cool teacher willing to help",
      "CS majors can't escape taking Ord at least once; believe me, once is enough to convince anyone that he is one of the greatest instructors, if not THE greatest instructor in the CS department. His comics, sense of humor, and endless knowledge make every lecture worth attending. Go Ord! (More coffee&#63;)",
      "funny guy. quizes and tests are just like the sample ones he gave out. not too good about posting the assignment on time, which sucks because you only have so much time to write your programs. pretty good class, if you're not tOOO bad at programming",
      "Best CSE prof I've had yet. Very clear, maintains an upbeat classroom atmosphere. Made learning the material a breeze.",
      "the best professor in CSE department.",
      "Fantastic teacher, the best I've had in the CS department so far. Lectures are clear and easy to follow, pretty easy to get a good grade in; I think the average in my class was in the mid 80s.",
      "Best CS teacher I've had. Programming assignments aren't overly difficult, and he gives tests/quizzes that are very similar to the practice ones he puts on the website. Pretty easy to get a good grade in this class.",
      "excellent professor",
      "Super nice teacher! homeworks are hard if you don't get it, but there's a lot of TA's to help you so you're most likely to get A's for homework. Midterms aren't bad since you can bring a sheet of notes with you. It's pretty easy to get A for this class.",
      "good teacher, hands out clear and descriptive notes, helpful, easy class, had 17 great TAs, no great need to read the book, but good if you want more examples and information",
      "Great teacher, teaches material well, i just hope i pass the class :o",
      "Despite not getting a very good grade in the class, Ord is still one of the best. His lectures aren't boring and he explains the material well.",
      "Best CS teacher on campus. There's a reason he wins teach of the year awards.",
      "Well spoken and knowledable",

      "Professor Cao is one of my favorite professors at UCSD, and I definitely learned a lot in this course. He cares about preparing students for the industry, and he's very reasonable. If you're good at computer science or are willing to put in the work, this class should be very fun and fairly easy.",
      "CSE8A and CSE8B thought by him are really fun. You can finish many interesting programs even though you are just a beginner. However, his CSE100 is hard and he is trying to make harder. Even though exams are easy, PAs take over 24 hours and you may not make it correct. I suggest to take CSE8A/B with him but dont take CSE100 with him!!!",
      "One of the best professors Ive had at UCSD. He really knows his stuff. I highly recommend you take his classes if you have the choice. The only slight drawback is that his accent can be a little bit difficult to understand at times.",
      "PAs are not extremely difficult, but they are time consuming Lecture is mandatory, Caring for students and listen to feedback Exams are not hard once you get the concept, I barely passed the first quiz and midterm, and got 100% on final after spent a lot of time studying the past exams",
      "The final exam was 261 out of 236, and average was 236, literally 100 percent. I would highly recommend Paul if you want to learn CS well. The class is by no mean easy, but I definitely enjoy the material in cs30",
      "If you go to the lectures and do the reading you will probably get the concept. He really explains things really well, the lecture is structural and clear. But the PAs are really time-consuming and tough, and you don't want to expect an extension. The quizzes and mid-term are tricky, I got a 50% on the midterm. The final is ok I got 100%.",
      "He really cares your learning and will take in student feedback. He would modify the class if the majority of the opinion reflected that they want the change. Awesome prof!",
      "One the best Professors at UCSD.",
      "The best way I can describe Paul is that he is a caring and very much a dad-figure to every one in the class. He makes it his goal to help you understand the rather confusing topics in Java and the in class examples (clicker questions) are incredibly helpful in demonstrating the nuances in the code. Do his quizzes on time and pay attention for an A",
      "Paul (Yingjun) knows what he is talking about and makes sure you understand. Reading quizzes three times per week and weekly programming assignments. The PA's can be time consuming and you will probably need help to complete them. 3 easy in-class quizzes.",
      "Paul (Yingjun) clearly knows what he is talking about and makes sure you do too. Reading quizzes three times per week, review quizzes and programming assignments due once per week. Weekly lab sections are useful. He has plenty of office hours and there are always tutors in the lab if you need help.",
      "If you want to learn Java, you should take this class. Paul (Yingjun) Cao goes into great depth explaining concepts, and will pause the lecture to expand on a concept if he feels that the class doesn't get a concept. Even though the PAs are time consuming, I found them relatively straightforward and educational. I did stuff last minute and got a B+",
      "He explains things really well. You can understand him clearly even if you don't have any programming experience previously. The programming assignments are a little tough but you will really learn the concepts better after finishing them. Besides, most of the time the assignments are really fun. Good luck!",
      "Knows his stuff. Reading quizzes every alternate day, review quizzes every week. Additional PSAs due every week. Lectures are informative and count for a small percentage of final grade.",
      "He's a great professor who really tries to make sure everyone understands and does well. Do your work and you're almost guaranteed an A. Easy midterms and final. Great class overall and great prof!",
      "A very good professor, can explain things very clear when you have a question.",
      "Paul Cao is a nice professor and tries really hard to make you understand the material, but the material itself is really difficult. There are too many quizzes that we have to take and you can never relax in the class because PSA's are due every week and they take forever to do. Midterm was hard.",
      "Prof. Cao is a well-respected teacher among all my friends. He is kind, accessible outside of class, and sometimes with unexpected humor. His course is well designed and well prepared. Follow his reading assignments, handouts, practice exams, programming assignments and lecture. You will find his assignments doable because he gets you ready.",
      "Professor Cao is a great instructor. He truly cares about your learning and will help you without judgement, especially on your exams. His lectures are a little hard to follow but he will slow down if you ask him to. There are quizzes during class but as long as you do your PSAs and attend lectures, you should be set. Studying is strongly recommend",
      "If you concentrate on lectures you won't need the book at all. You will get an easy A if you take him",
      "has a clear grading standard to follow. easy to pick up all the point.",
      "Professor Cao's class has been my favorite at ucsd so far. Attendance is mandatory, but I enjoyed his lectures. Exams were very fair. I appreciate that he asks for criticism and comments from his students to improve his own teaching.",
      "Overall a good professor. Exam and quiz got harder this quarter but you should be fine if you study and pay attention during lecture.",
      "Mr. Cao is a wonderful teacher. His lectures are very well structured, and deliver important information. There are reading quizzes due on the morning of each lecture, so reading is important. His class is not extremely difficult, but it isn't a catwalk. 10/10 would take again",
      "One of the best professor. True. The class is time consuming. Reading quizzes, PSA, but all the cse classes are. It is not his fault. The class is not that hard if you just follow his step. Professor Can is approachable and inspiring. Clear in explaining concepts. I think the university should let him teach more cse classes. He really cares about",
      "Professor Cao is the best professor I've had at UCSD so far! His lectures are packed with valuable knowledge and material so going to lectures will definitely help your grade. All his PAs are explained very clearly and graded fairly as well. He's one of those professor where going to lecture is actually really worth it! Definitely recommend!",
      "For those who claim Cao is not clear enough, I think they won't find any cs professor they like in ucsd. Take him, you will get an easy A and have solid cs fundation.",
      "Very veerrrry nice person!!! It is really my pleasure to meet such a nice CSE professor. The final is very identical to all the previous works we had done so far. He gives all the materials such as podcast, past papers, lecture slides notes, study guide, etc. You can prepare all well and develop a strong base of CSE. Take this prof!!!",
      "There's a lot of work in this class. (Labs, quizzes, homework, midterms) He posts everything online. He even posted the podcast of when we took our midterm, so it was a podcast of us staring at a watch for 80 minutes. But he is pretty good at explaining and he tries really hard. Getting a passing grade isn't hard, but you have to work for the A.",
      "Fun class, great professor. Never leaves anyone behind.",
      "Good prof. Very clear and fair. He challenges you to know material, but if you put in the effort and start hw early, you can definitely get an A. Just START EARLY and go to tutors for help and you are golden",
      "CSE 8B is harder than 8A, but you have so many chances to get extra credits. Problem Solving Assignments are more fun but more time-consuming. Get ready to devote a couple weekends to PSAs!",
      "Most would say accent is a problem, but it really is not. Attend lecture or watch podcast, and the tests would be chill. PAs will take time, especially pa2 (start wordcloud early). TA's are great. Tutors are great. In essence, he knows what he is doing.",
      "Wouldn't have been the same without Cao! He's able to explain concepts well and in a way that's easy to understand. Granted, there are certain topics that are just harder to grasp, but he genuinely cares for his students and how they are performing. Coding assignment range from really hard to easy, and quizzes and exams are not hard but not easy",
      "I love Professor Cao! He explains everything very clearly and goes through each problem in detail even if no one asks (in case you're shy). There are lots of good examples&info in clicker questions that will help on projects! He's very kind with grading and extra help, and he takes time before class to just sit down and chat with students :)",
      "He is a nice professor. He explains things clearly and his tests are fair",
      "Professor Cao is super patient. However hard ur question is, he will answer u wiz a lot of details and make sure u understand it.",
      "His classes are interesting and the exams are not too hard.",
      "Awesome class. He was very clear and you knew exactly what he wanted you to know thanks to his good use of iclicker questions. My only problem with the class was the fact every assignment (once a week) was with a partner. All around, easy and well-educating class. And he podcasts. Find the book online.",
      "Professor Cao teaches the material well and allows the students ample time to discuss questions amongst themselves. The course material was easy in itself so it's hard to say how much he really helped me. The one thing I really liked about him was how he made an effort to talk to students outside the class. Great professor!",
      "Gives a lot of discussion time",
      "Cao is an excellent, helpful, and reassuring professor. 1st midterm average was 92%, and the day the first project was due, he opened up tutor hours until midnight. He has an accent, but is easy enough to understand. Attendance is mandatory. \"It's normal to become frustrated when programming. But don't get discouraged; you can do it!\" -Cao",
      "Awesome, one of the best professor that I have ever met. His lectures are so interesting and helpful!",
      "Very good professor, very clear about what is needed for the students to get good grades. He always give good feedback and is very nice to students and very patient to students' questions."

      "Her lectures are very engaging, will keep your attention throughout! She is also very caring and has a clear passion and energy for what she teaches. The homework can be EXTREMELY tough at times though as in there are times I just sit in front of the computer the entire day and code.",
      "Amazing professor with great lectures. She really wants you to learn and understand the material, and pushes students to meet before, after, or outside of class if they feel like they're falling behind. Really cares. But you'll have to work HARD for your grade-- homeworks are long, comprehensive, and thorough.",
      "Marina is a perfect professor but homeworks in this class are extremely heavy and hard.",
      "Marina Marina Marina, I think this is my second time giving her a review. She is a great person to talk to in office hours and outside of class but she is ruthless elsewhere. The homeworks are HARD and LONG, it feels like I am taking only the one class because it is so time-consuming. She talks fast and flies through powerpoints. She doesnt seem to",
      "Great Prof, just very hard",
      "Marina is an awesome and funny teacher. She made the lectures entertaining and usually asked students if they needed help on a particular topic or if she needed to go over a topic again. She is super helpful and made my time in her classes enjoyable.",
      "Marina is a very solid prof. Although she doesn't explain concepts in as much detail as she should and lags behind her schedule(makes the homework trickier), she will help you learn the material well by giving loads of homework. Helps get a higher grade by giving quite a lot of easily attainable points(clicker etc).",
      "She is good at teaching computer courses. Although she will leave you a lot of homework, it worth. Because the only way you can learning programming skill is to keep practicing. She is nice to every student she taught and she always makes the whole lecture interesting not boring like the normal programming lecture.",
      "Professor Langlois has very-collaborative lecture style. Be prepared to answer many clicker questions and have group discussions. I don't like when people complain about her accent. As a Russian-Chinese I would say English is truly different than a lot of other languages (especially the pronunciation), so be tolerant!",
      "Super enthusiastic and patient. Actually goes through each data structure inside out, including all run times of each functionality. A mix of homework between fun and relevant programming assignments (like implementing a data structure from scratch and using it for a real life scenario like a maze/spell checker) and runtime analysis/problems.",
      "Lot of the reviews here are pretty accurate. She has a strong Russian accent (I understood it clearly though since I've heard Russian accents before). She is really nice and tries hard, but she also gives a LOT of homework (way too much in my opinion). She should've given us a break during the midterm week. She also has a nice ass.",
      "Super nice professor who teaches mostly through clicker questions (ungraded, participation points), which I enjoyed. Her Russian accent is strong, but I found it very clear and entertaining -- like most people find English accents.",
      "She's a caring person but the lecture was mostly clicker Qs, not actual teaching! So it was pretty hard for a CS beginner like me to keep up with everything. Readings are LONG! Midterms+final were pretty difficult. PSAs were fun but stressful/challenging. Felt like the class was mostly self-taught, so it's tough for beginners.",
      "She cares about her students and have a lot of passion for teaching. That gives me a comfortable learning environment and I enjoy taking all her classes.",
      "She is one of my favorite professors so far! She is extremely sweet /funny, & she always takes the pace of her class into consideration in terms of content. It can be difficult to understand her through her thick accent, but she will also gladly repeat herself and explain things thoroughly if necessary. The assignments can be time consuming!",
      "By far my favorite professor I have had/most likely will have. Her lectures were the only ones I was actually engaged in, and she explained most of the concepts very well. The only complaint was we skimmed over C and then had a huge project on it-it was difficult but doable! In terms of final and midterms, just go over the practice probs she gives",
      "She is really really cute! My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed her lectures for this course and we will take another course taught by her again definitely. She is very clear while teaching and her lectures are always engaging because she has tricky but fun iClicker questions and encourage group discussions.",
      "She is very enthusiastic in lectures and was very entertaining. Fairly time consuming class but I learned a lot and it was fun!",
      "Most of the assignments are in java. The biggest problem of her class is that she didn't really teach C so as to make the last and the only C assignment to have a 47/100 median. She does give a lot of extra credit and she has an accent. The instructions on homework and exams are pretty ambiguous. But you could really learn some cool stuff.",
      "She's really funny and one of the most caring professors I've had. The midterm was and final were both fair. PA's are challenging but just make sure you're thorough in implementation and use piazza to your advantage.",
      "I feel that she really cares about her students. Granted that here communication skills aren't the best, but she makes up for it by her charismatic lectures. I can guarantee that if you start the PA's early, you will learn data structures well and thrive in this class. You didn't learn C thoroughly but what you learn is enough for CSE30.",
      "At first, her assignment guidelines were very vague and hard to follow, but towards the end of the quarter, they became clearer. Homeworks are hard, and midterm was fair but too long for allotted time. Final was very fair. I think she's a really good professor, and I feel like I learned a lot in her class. However, C isn't taught so g'luck in CSE30",
      "She's a great lecturer. I thought the grading was a little ambiguous, but she did provide a great deal of extra credit opportunities. I learned a lot in her class, and the assignments were very helpful, and also very difficult. There were a couple that I didn't finish in time. She had us using several different websites for homework, confusing.",
      "She is really nice. The class is really easy",
      "Sometimes confusing PA writeup, but otherwise very clear and also forgiving teacher. The tests are a little rough so expect to study real hard. Very nice woman and really easy to communicate with. She's here for you! Took her over Gary for 12 and feel like that's a major reason I got to transfer into CS.",
      "Love her! The assignments were super helpful and she really cares about the students.",
      "Shes a great teacher, and she helps you out.",
      "One of the best professor I've taken, material is easy to understand if you pay attention in class. She gives an incredible amount of extra credit so I mean.. if you start your assignment early (as for all cs classes), you can very easily get a solid A in this class. Understand the purpose of your coding assignments and tests will be a breeze.",
      "As long as you pay attention and start the assignments early you'll be perfectly fine. The programming assignment write-ups are a bit less structured than you're used to, but consequently the grading guidelines are looser.",
      "You have to pay for Zybook which is useless. She has strong accent and she makes mistakes in her slides",
      "Kindest professor I've ever seen in UCSD. Assignments are useful. Instructions on assignment can be sometimes not clear, but she is there for you in person or on piazza if you ask. She does have an accent but I am able to understand. Exams are fair enough if you do understand the lecture material and read some online resources yourself after class.",
      "Professor Langlois is a great lecturer although she do have a mild accent. She is always there to help her students after class or during office hour, and she really cares about your feelings. Her homework write-up could be ambiguous , but if you ask her on piazza or in person you should be fine. She teaches you everything you should learn."

      "Lots of lecture, lots of homework, mandatory attendance via clicker polls. However, Alvarado is an excellent professor who cares about the students and explains stuff very well.",
      "She is an amazing lecturer who can make any dumb person understand tough concepts. Given my aversion towards math I was so sure I will drop this class but thanks to her amazing inspirational lectures I didn't give up. Her staff is amazing and knowledgable. I just wish she taught more AI courses.",
      "She is an amazing professor! She herself is kind and friendly, and is always willing to help us to get into the field of CSE. Her lectures are always clear and understandable, I love her way of teaching sooooo much! Her PSAs have very clear requirements so that we are able to follow the instructions. Do take her classes !!",
      "Nice Professor! If you see her teaching the course you want, you must choose her!",
      "Professor Alvarado is super amazing. She's the type of typical-science-field-professor, but you'll always find her super inspirational. She really cares her students, and she encourages students a lot. This is the first time I ever touch this field, and she makes the experience super interesting. And she's a super great lecturer! CSE 8A ROCKS!",
      "Great Professor, I was able to pretty much skip a few lectures and justing by looking at the power points; I was able to fully complete the &quot;PSA&quot; a few days before the deadline. The only problem I have is that there were to many assignments to worry about. OverAll great prof.",
      "Professor Alvarado is a great lecturer, she explains the material at an understandable pace and make pauses to make sure everyone is on the same page. However this only stands if you do your pre-class reading, definitely don't expect her to explain things to you from ground up. Her PAs can get a bit tough, be prepared to spend your weekends coding.",
      "Great lecturer! Prof. Alvarado gives very deep and representative in class and assigns very interesting PAs for practice. Definitely would take her class again in the future!",
      "She is just pure awesome. I learn't just so much. Her assignments taught me a ton. Her exams were tough but fair. I was inspired after taking her class. She further kindered my interest in Data Science. She further proves that women can be rockstars in Software and Tech.",
      "The two biggest pros to Alvarado CSE100 are the great lecturing and the great choices of topics, but there's a lot more to like about it than that. The PAs are very challenging but they teach you a huge amount both on the theoretical and implementation levels. The slides and resources are extremely well-made. Very responsive and helpful as well.",
      "Prof Alvarado was a great teacher. The class was hard, but certainly not impossible. Start PAs early, especially the last one, it's a ton of work. The midterms were pretty hard, her grading is fair. I feel that I learned a lot in this course, and I think I got a decent grade as well.",
      "She's overall an awesome choice. But I have no idea why she gives a required extension part for PA4. Which is a total pain. You need to spend tons of time to get only a very small portion of the grade for that pa. I just hope this could be star point instead of required.",
      "She makes u a data structures and C++ pro. She is very organized and her lectures are awesome. We were lucky her ta's were good. I really had a nice experience and I feel so sad she wouldnt teach more upper division courses :(",
      "pay attention in her class,attend discussion, start early on the pa's & do the reading and quizzes regularly, you will become a c++ and data structures pro. And a A grade if that is good motivation. The only class i was diligent and it was totally worth it. She is the best and her TAs are great. Her tests are so easy and She is the bestest",
      "Do yourself a favor and take her for every class that you can. Hands down the best cse teacher in ucsd. Her lectures are amazing, and her TA's and discussion sections are super helpful. I learned so much from this class.",
      "Nobody can teach data structures better than her. She had open-ended programming assignments, challenging optional extensions, an amazing free online text book. Her tests are from her quizzes , worksheets and slides. Her TA' s and tutors were great. I just wish we didnt have work every day and had a break between assignments. It was too stressful.",
      "How much work you put in, will determine your grade. She gives you all the tools for success, it's up to you to use them. Probably the best CSE lecturer I've had. Does a great job explaining, and her test are very representative of what you learn, with a little challenge.",
      "Great professor; had her for 8A, 12, 90, and 191. Definitely recommend",
      "I took a version of the class that had many TA's and small sections. Alvarado and the TA were fatastic . They cared about our learning experience. The exams were similar to the quizzes. The PA's difficulty increased gradually. My TA and some tutors even had extra exam review sessions that helped. Fair grading and great support system.",
      "CSE 100 is such an important subject and Alvarado is an awesome lecturer . She has too many quizzes and policies that make it hectic. To get a good grade you need to do well in all components of the course. Her PA's were hard but it really helped in improving my confidence as a programmer. Start early on the Homework and it will all be worth it.",
      "Solid lecturer, really enthusiastic about teaching. The class is definitely well-organized, and I learned a lot from it.",
      "Excellent professor, maybe the best one I ever had! Prof. Alvarado is very clear, makes sure everyone has understood the material and wants everyone to pass. She's very nice and her course are very interesting.",
      "Very interesting class. Coding intensive. Started out okay. After week4, it got pretty hectic. Exams, classes, assignments, exams, classes, assignments. But, learnt a lot. She could have organized it better, planned it so the work load was more uniform. Towards the end of the quarter I was so relieved it was over.",
      "Alvarado is great, but from what I have gathered, her 100 is harder than other 100's. If vocareum is correct, the class avg is a 69% and midterms avg is 67%. She didn't curve. Would not take with her again ONLY because of the relative difficulty. If you check CAPE, the other 100's have avg grades of B-/B and her other 100 has an avg of C+.",
      "The course is definitely well-designed. There are all sorts of resources and opportunities given to help you get used to coding, especially for people who had no prior experience. Honestly, exams are not difficult but can be hard to have a very good scores. Takes a lot of time outside classroom for homework.",
      "Professor Alvarado is a great computer science professor, especially if you have no experience with coding (like me when before I took this course). Her enthusiasm and energy every lecture definitely helps keep you awake. Definitely would take a class with her again if possible!",
      "Take Alvarado if you can! 8A was more interesting with her enthusiasm and she knows what she's doing. Tests were okay and assignments were difficult, but it's not her fault, computer science is just a harder subject in the first place . But if you do whatever is required and spend the extra time outside of class studying then you should be fine",
      "Awesome professor! Her explanations are very clear, the class structure is great. One of the best professors I had. Expect to spend some time outside of class working on assignments.",
      "Awesome teacher. Took her for 8B and going to have her again for 100. Makes topics very simple and knows her stuff.",
      "I thought she was a very nice professor with a positive attitude towards teaching in lectures. She's your best choice for this class. I felt that her assignments weren't always the clearest. They were hard. I had to ask for help from others in the class as well as ask on piazza. Her tests are hard but fair. The pre-class quizzes got annoying.",
      "Very nice professor. Feeling sad that she is not teaching 8B this winter.",
      "GREAT professor. Clear, easy to understand, and fair grader. One of the best-structured courses I've ever taken that requires a good amount of participation (for your benefit). Quizzes were fair -- somewhat challenging but never unreasonable. One of the better CS professors at UCSD, in my opinion.",
      "Fantastic teacher who actually cares whether you learn or not! She even sends you a progress report discussing how you're doing in the middle of the quarter. Her projects are hard but doable and midterm and final were very fair. Only problem is if you hate busy work (or already know the material) it can be tedious. I recommend her fully!",
      "She excelled at teaching the concepts, students were rarely confused when it came to the topics presented in lecture. The homework, however, was a lot more confusing and the instructions usually were too vague and left the majority of students confused as to what was required. The tests were very fair.",
      "She's one of the best lecturers I know. You could get by without needing to take notes because you have to read before class and take a reading quiz. She enforces the material using clickers for participation. It's a fun class and she made cookies for everyone at the end.",
      "Alvarado is energetic and knowledgable. Lectures are very clear; slides are usually posted online the night before. The reading is redundant if you go to lecture or can read Oracle's documentation, but there are reading quizzes at the beginning of most classes. 4 very short in-term exams were manageable with light studying, final moderate.",
      "Great professor and the most interesting and engaging class I had this quarter. She gives you enough assignments so that there's room for error/improvement unlike many other classes based on like, 3 exams and a few quizzes. Attendance is essential to pass. Not intimidating at all, and really friendly. Drops lowest grades in most categories.",
      "Christine is the best professor/teacher I have ever had. I can't imagine a case where signing up for her class wouldn't be top priority. Suuuuper generous with grades, very positive person, crystal clear and always willing to help. Seriously, take her. You will not regret it.",
      "Christine is one of the BEST professors I've ever had. She genuinely cares about her students and she is ALWAYS willing to help you if you don't understand something. Attendance is mandatory because of daily quizzes (iClicker) but she's so fun and it was always a joy going to her lectures. TAKE HER! She's amazing.",
      "Was very very nice. Always answered questions and actually made lecture fun! It made me want to change my major to computer science. If you can get Alvarado for a class, then do it.",
      "Really cares about her students and wants everyone to do well. As long as you attend lectures and read for the clicker quizzes you'll do fine. I had no prior programming experience and learned alot. She was a joy to have for my very first comp sci professor and made the class great.",
      "She's very enthusiastic, loves computer science, and actually cares about students' understanding. Definitely take her if you can. She teaches all the info very well. Know how to do all the clicker questions and you should be fine since it's an intro class.",
      "She's good. Very enthusiastic and engaging. Does help a lot outside of class! Had a lot of additional interesting information about the subject we studied."

      "Great Professor! Would definitely recommend. Caring and approachable. Always willing to help. Will take questions in lecture explain thoroughly .",
      "Diba is a super great lecturer. She makes things so clear and easy to understand and she is super nice! This is the first CS class that I understood what was being taught in lecture. Her PA's are also reasonable and she gives you enough tools to finish them.",
      "Learned a lot of Assembly and how to implement them. The Tests really test concepts, but she reviews it beforehand in class. Lenient and understanding towards student difficulties. A gem of professionalism Hope UCSB treats her better than we deserve",
      "The professor indeed has tried all her best to teach us. Have you even seen a professor who even annotated each slide so clearly for you? Whenever you went to her office hour, she was super nice and teach you so clearly. Do you a favor and take her if you have the chance.",
      "Diba is the greatest. She's super sweet and funny, and her lectures are excellent. She extends assignment deadlines when she deems appropriate. The exams were very fair based on her lectures and programming assignments. She doesn't give away the answers in the lectures, but she gives you what you need to succeed. Really enjoyed her class.",
      "I thought Professor Mirza was one of the best professors I've ever had. Not only in the CS department, but at UCSD as a whole. Her class is challenging, but if you aren't prepared for/excited by a challenge then you really shouldn't be taking CS classes much less attempting to major in it. She is a great professor! Take her if you get the chance.",
      "Wowww so many negative feedback for Diba. She is one of the nicest and great CS professor I have had so far at UCSD. People just bitter about their grade and how she doesn't curve. ECE doesn't curve either and their class average is 50%.... it just how it is. You have to work hard to earn your grade!!! the tutors, TA and prof are awesome.",
      "TBH I am a bit salty she didn't round up my 92.8 to an A but whatever bc the class wasn't that hard. I never read the textbook she assigned us. The midterms were a bit tricky at times and unrelated to the PAs but she covered mostly everything on the exams in lecture. Final was pretty easy too. Quizzes, however, are a nightmare.",
      "Absolutely one of the best professors at UCSD, period. Diba is an inspiration to us all. Her lectures are very valuable, PAs are more than reasonable. The midterms and final are well representative of the material taught in the class.",
      "Great professor overall. Tricky midterms, but the final was super fair game. PAs are reasonable, and she really listened to everyone's complaints and criticism to improve the class as we went on.",
      "A good professor, easy coding assignment and likely to extend due date if necessary. Exams are not hard, but can be tricky, make sure you prepared very well before you attend her exam, DON'T miss a word on her slide, a few words can worth lots of points, REALLY LOTS. Not likely to curve, really strict cutoff.",
      "One of the greatest cs professors at UCSD! Lectures are clear and concise. Attend office hours if you are struggling Probably the most fun I've had learning cs at UCSD",
      "Dumbest comment ever: \" she ALWAYS changes the due date of coding assignments without any announcement which is horrible!!\". Yeah, each time she EXTENDED the due date. She did announce the extensions, in class. If you are really that dumb enough to post a stupid comment then you probably should jump out the house on top of Warren.",
      "One of the best CS profs @ UCSD. Haters claim class is difficult , however over a third of students got an A. Another third got a B. We never had complicated C coding at all. This means the ARM code was fairly straightforward. The whiners were probably the same kids I had w/ CSE 21 last quarter who were the most disrespectful/entitled kids.",
      "Diba is the best professor I have ever had the privilege to learn from. Her knowledge and teaching skills are incredible . Its easy to get lost in certain CS concepts, but Diba makes these concepts easy to grasp by carefully expolring them in lecture in utmost detail. Any comment that she is a bad professor simply comes from a bad student.",
      "Professor Diba Mirza is a blessing to UCSD. I was one of the lucky students who was able to take her CSE 30 class before she left the school. Every day she comes to class she brings her humor, insight, and kindness. She is a fair professor, and honestly her students love her for it. I like the CSE profs at UCSD, but Diba is by far my favorite.",
      "One of my favorite professors. Enjoyed speaking to her after class and is a fair grader. My quarter people were very rude to her :( The etiquette standards are much lower for the student-professor relationship than they used to be, even 3 years ago when I started at UCSD",
      "She is one of the best CSE professors I have had in my a little longer than one year of college. Her lectures are pretty clear. Not too many programming assignments. A quiz per week online which you can do twice. Exams are not hard as well as long as you study it. I am so glad I took her CSE 30 in her last quarter at UCSD. Great professor!",
      "Diba is a great professor, bunch of whiners. All of the schedule changes were to the students benefit. Tests are hard, what did you expect? be greatly missed .",
      "Diba is a great professor. She's an inspirational professor who is really passionate about what she is teaching. Sure, her class isn't an easy, but it is definitely fair. You just have to study and really understand the material inside out. I'm sad that she is leaving UCSD. UCSB is so lucky to have her now!",
      "\"She is a very good lecturer and very clear. I am not sure why other people are complaining, she really cares about her students. Would take again. 0\"",
      "So I see that the earlier negative rating was posted on the day of our midterm (today lol)- it's true that I think one of the questions was a little screwed up, but they were pretty generous with the grading. Important to note that the code-writing questions on Diba's tests are never hard b/c she understands how much time pressure we're under.",
      "One of the best professor I've ever had, she is really enthusiastic about teaching, and makes every concept crystal clear. Exams and grading are really fair.",
      "Diba is an amazing human being and a brilliant professor. I highly recommend her. She is very enthusiastic and interested in teaching the material. She takes everybody's questions and is very helpful and clear. She's also very approachable. Do not miss this opportunity.",
      "Really solid professor who's always ready for class. I highly recommend her. I'm really glad that I got to take this course with her. She also records her lectures just in case you don't understand something the first time around. The exams were straightforward but were unforgiving. A small mistake could cost you a letter grade. So be careful.",
      "Professor Diba is the most amazing cs professor at UCSD. Took her for 30 in fall, 100 in winter, and now 140 in spring. I would take her for every cs class at UCSD if possible. She's so enthusiastic and witty and makes cs enjoyable. I actually feel confident regarding the material she teaches. Would recommend!",
      "I really enjoying taking the class with her. She really cares about the content she teaches and her students. It was especially helpful that she recorded her lectures for podcasts when classes ran low on time. I also like she annotated the slides. Her tests were fair too with practice exams given beforehand. Highly recommended.",
      "I took CSE30 with her during summer 2015. Despite of the pace during summer session, she was able to cover all the materials as of in a regular quarter. Her PA's are straightforward but her tests are somehow tricky. If you want to do well, make sure you understand all concepts very well. Hard A.",
      "shes super enthusiastic about the material which rubs off on me and makes me super enthusiastic about the material.",
      "Programming Assignments were somewhat challenging. Midterm and Final was pretty difficult. Daily reading quizzes, but the questions were posted the day before so you can prepare.",
      "Overall really solid teacher, lectures are very clear, somewhat interesting. She is fairly funny. Quiz questions and multiple choice on midtermfinal can be tricky. Easy B, very possible to get an A",
      "FA14. Great professor. Lectures are very clear, homework can be tricky, but isn't too bad. Exams are fair. Very willing to help during lecture. Pretty good sense of humor. Fairly easy-going. Check your edge cases.",
      "Professor Mirza's lectures are clear and does a really good job of condensing the reading into a nice set of annotated slides which are made available online after class. Would take her again.",
      "Great lecturer, happy to talk to you after class and during office hours. Excellent slides annotated during lecture. Uses clickers in class to help drive discussion. Shapes her lectures based on student input. Clickers count for participation.",
      "You need to really know what you're doing to do well. Blind memorization will not be enough. If you truly try your best, I believe you can get the grade you set out for. But you'll definitely need to work for it.",
      "Far less intimidating than other CSE faculty, and appears to genuinely enjoy interacting with students. Lecture is generally pretty clear. You can space out when she spends too long on a proof, but anything related to the assignments is useful. Reading quizzes are a joke. As with any CSE class here, the tutorsPiazza are your best bet for help."

      "Professor Simon is a very good lecturer and promotes us to ask questions and discuss topics with our peers.Her midterm and final were pretty easy, but the class in general took a lot more time than I had hoped. She gives a ton of busy work, which is waste of time, so, if you want to take a \"filler class\" where you can goof off this is not it!",
      "Easy and not an intolerable amount of work. This class was very manageable, if you do everything you're supposed to do: attend class, do the prelab and maybe skim through the textbook once in a while ( like 10-15mins a day for studying after the first few weeks/ you get the hang of Alice) you will get an A. Very reasonable class and professor.",
      "Class isnt hard, it's just that there is a lottt to do. Labs are annoyingly long and can take the whole 2 hrs. Might be best for you to come in 30 min earlier to make sure you finish on time. There is a quiz every week (lowest two dropped), a project, a midterm, a final, and some other little random assignments online that take about 10-20 min.",
      "Class is very time consuming. Lots of unnecessary work. Prof tries too hard to make the class engaging, like making assignments that help you appreciate technology. It's easy if you can keep up with the classwork and coming to lecture everyday (clicker questions).",
      "This class is A LOT harder than everyone made it up to be. I mean, people told me I'd learn what a mouse was. Wrong! I think the &quot;super easy&quot; rep came from Marx since she normally teaches this class. I thought that what I'd learn would at least be useful. Wrong again! I am never going to open up Alice again thank you!",
      "Having taken CSE3 in fall, I have to agree with the previous comment that this course is over-hyped as &quot;easy.&quot; The labs are stressful in that you have to rush to finish them, but the class is pretty average. You just have to spend time putting the effort.",
      "Professor Simon's an amazing professor. She truly cares about teaching and works hard to help students learn. The weekly labs can be annoying but as a whole, this class was easy as long as you do the work and pay attention. Her midterm and final questions are very similar to questions in class.",
      "Will go out of her way to help students. Clearly cares a lot about what she does and the material she teaches",
      "TAKE THIS CLASS. Easiest credits you'll ever earn. Our 550 person class has an overall average of 90%. I've got an A without reading the book, paying attention in class, and half-assing all my labs. If you go to class and finish your labs you should be fine.",
      "Great professor for both 8A/8B. Truly cares about teaching well. May talk a little fast. I had no prior experience in coding and was trying the field out, but she made it a lot simpler. assignments are hard so start early. weekly quizzes. does in class clicker questions that really help. wish she taught more cse classes",
      "AMAZING Professor! She really cares about her students and is the ONLY professor I've had at UCSD so far that goes out of her way to ensure that the student can grasp the material. I attribute the HIGH grades in her class not from the easiness of the material, but rather, from her motivating style of teaching.",
      "Great professor! Just wished she taught other CSE courses as well.",
      "To imagine how hard this class is for ppl w/ no experience in comp sci, picture a novice chef trying to cook something with no recipe. The codes we create for our PSAs are A LOT MORE complex than textbook & lecture examples. The only way to understand how to do the PSAs is by going through struggling hours of experimentation on codes.",
      "Great professor! Take her if you can.",
      "Passionate about teaching and helping students. I personally had a difficult time in this class struggled with PSAs and Exams. No longer pursuing a CSE major.",
      "Enthusiastic professor, great teacher. The class is easy but you still learn what you are supposed to. Also gives CSE major advice. Quizzes are a bit hard but are only 4% of the grade.",
      "Just do and understand your PSA by yourself and you'll do fine on midterms and finals",
      "Easily one of the best professors I've ever had. She is so enthusiastic about what she teaches, it's hard not to be interested as well. Uses technology to teach, another plus with me.",
      "Excellent professor. One of the best i've had during college. She really cares about her students and their learning, so is always doing research to find the best teaching strategies. I would recommend her for anyone.",
      "She is AWESOME. Extremely helpful, very cool, one of those rare teacher who actually care about the students' learning and try their best to help them. She always tries out new things to make the class more interesting and fun. I loved her! but sometimes she words her homeworks and questions a little confusingly",
      "Good professor. For 8A there is a bit too much hand-holding - labs, PSA interviews, pair programming - if you need it - good, if not it's annoying. However she is willing to give you advice being a CSE major. A good class to take first quarter",
      "She is a great teacher and cares about her students. She is willing to help anyone who seek her help. You can learn a lot in her class, and you'll love her class. I highly recommend this proffessor.",
      "Awesome professor - my favorite so far. Her research deals with using technology to teach, which . . . makes her a great teacher. The class is fairly easy, and she's such a good lecturer that you hardly need the textbook at all. Don't hesitate to take Simon!",
      "very good teacher for beginning cs students. very enthusiastic and cares about her students.",
      "AWESOME Teacher!!! Always try to find new ways to help students undertstand",
      "She's passionate about computing and teaching, which is a stellar combination for this class. She throws in some career advice, trivia, and prizes here and there, but keeps the class focused. Challenging at times, but the challenges are worth it. Highly recommended.",
      "As uninterested in this subject as I am, she made it as interesting as humanly possible. Just show up, pay attention, STUDY THE SAMPLE EXAM QUESTIONS and you can get an A. She is a pretty cool lady.",
      "This class is one of the easiest computer science classes at UCSD. Prof. Simon makes the class really interesting, and its not hard to get an A if you have common sense and go to class.",
      "Professor Simon is an awesome professor. She is very enthusiastic and genuinely cares about her students' learning. She explains the material in a clear and concise manner and is always well prepared for class. Overall this prof is awesome and I hope to get her again.",
      "Beth is a great Professor and does her best with a difficult subject. The class is sometimes difficult (psas towards the end suck!!), but she actually teaches and you learn a lot!",
      "she's a really great teacher, and she's easy to talk to. Class is a bit confusing at times, but she can help you out with no problem.",
      "Absolutely awesome professor. You couldn't ask for a more understanding and easy-to-talk-to computer science professor."

      "Absolutely fantastic professor and person. Incredibly accomplished yet humble and inspiring. I would recommend Professor Dasgupta 1000 times over.",
      "Sanjoy is one of the rare profs who are amazing in all ways. I learnt so much from him by simply just attending his lecture. If you are at UCSD, you HAVE to take his course!",
      "You have to take 250B under Dasgupta. He is simply awesome!",
      "Great lectures, amazing depth of knowledge.",
      "His professor is awesome. You can't say you are a student in Computer Science at UC San Diego if you never take his course.",
      "Inspirational",
      "One of my favorite lecturers at UCSD. He wrote the textbook too!",
      "One of UCSD's best lecturers. Go to class and you'll learn so much.",
      "Algorithms are fundamentally important for any CS/CE student, and Dasgupta the best at it. Having co-written the textbook used by students at other universities including Berkeley, the material in his lectures are clear and identical to the that of his textbook. The homework was tough, but the quizzes were extremely easy by comparison.",
      "Sanjoy Dasgupta is one of those rare professors that you'll get once every blue moon. He is extremely good at teaching and will make sure that you walk out of every lecture with a good understanding of what he just taught. Outside of lecture, he is also very helpful as he shows great care for his students performances. Take dasgupta for cse 101.",
      "Sanjoy is fantastic. Best I have ever had",
      "Seriously he is the best professor I had in UCSD!!!!! His notes are clear and organized. His lecture is easy to understand. I love this professor!!!!",
      "Ive heard a ton of good things from this professor so I waited for him. Lectures are simple and clear. Professor seems to care a lot and he employees a great TA named Quentin. But the weekly quizzes/2 midterms does get annoying and the class is not easy. Prepare to spend a lot of time doing the homeworks. he is also lenient on failing people",
      "One awesome professor, and exams were really fair, but you should definitely perfect doing your homework before calling yourself a master otherwise you will make stupid mistakes.",
      "He really knows how to teach. If you put the time in to this class you will learn fundamental algorithm techniques that actually stick.This could've been theory intensive, but he made understandable and applicable.",
      "One of the best at UCSD. Download the podcasts and keep the book for posterity, he's that good.",
      "Awesome professor. One of my favorite professors at UCSD. Everyone should make an effort to take algorithms with him. Pay special attention to the hw's and read the book.",
      "Sanjoy is a boss. This topic is difficult (especially the topics prior to the first midterm). Keep up with the reading and do the homework with a group.",
      "He's the best math professor at UCSD. His lectures are clear and helpful, which make reading the book optional. He's also extremely helpful during office hours if you need help with homeworks. Exams and quizzes are fair as long as you put your time on practicing how to write algorithms and other materials he covered in class.",
      "GOOD prof but quiz and exam is hard",
      "He's cool. He takes things slowly.",
      "I guess, his lecture is excellent and he has good sense of humor. However, it does not really guarantee good grade.( I guess, more than 30% class dropped the cse 103.)",
      "One of the greatest professors I&#472;e had",
      "Dasgupta is an excellent lecturer with a good sense of humor. His slides are concise and clear, and follow the textbook (since he co-wrote it). The material and homeworks are somewhat difficult, but if you keep at it and practice and study, the exams are not too bad. One of the best CS profs I've encountered.",
      "Amazing professor. Clarity and total awareness of how his material is affecting students as he presents it.",
      "Fantastic professor, one of the few on campus that are extremely talented and can actually teach. Homeworks were challenging at times, but overall very fair. Midterms usually consisted of a few homework problems. Dasgupta was one of the best lecturers I've ever had (in any department) and the class was very rewarding.",
      "The beginning of the class is easy, but it gets progressively harder so watch out. Awesome professor, his lectures are actually worth while. Watch out for other students, for some reason everyone was HIGHLY competitive.",
      "Nice guy and a good lecturer. Homeworks were really hard and harshly graded. Another awful theory class but good prof.",
      "I thought Algorithms would be absolutely dreadful, but Prof Dasgupta actually made it interesting. He is one of the clearest, most systematic and thorough lecturers I've ever encountered. He freaking wrote the textbook so it fits perfectly with the class. Great inclass examples. Homeworks are tough but promote learning, tests are easy. GREAT PROF.",
      "Excellent teacher. Take him for algorithms if you can. Homework is pretty harsh, but tests are pretty easy for the most part.",
      "Excellent lecturer. Has an accent but it doesn't affect anything. Made algorithms interesting! I felt like I learned a lot from class, but I was manhandled by the homeworks. The TA's give away the answers though, so go to OH if you need help on hwk. Tests are easier than hwk but still tough..",
      "Extremely interesting lectures. (The only boring ones in CSE91 were when he had guest speakers.) His accent is NOT thick, and he's perfectly easy to understand once you hear him for 5 minutes and get acclimated to it. Homework and quizzes are extremely easy. Easy -- but FUN -- pass. Go to lecture.",
      "The class is insanely easy, maybe two homework assignments and a single quiz all quarter. His accent is really thick though, hard to understand. A lot of the material covered is meaningless and a waste of your time.",
      "Extremely well taught class. Lectures were very clear and made a potentially dull subject interesting. Very well organized, makeing note taking easy. Also provided complete lecture notes, so note taking wasn't necessary. One of the best classes I've ever taken.",
      "Has absolutely the best lectures! Is very clear, precise, and most of all interesting! Makes great analogies to difficult topics."

      "Really nice professor. Eloquent and cares about students. Articulate lectures. Well organized slides. Homework is challenging but not too time-consuming.",
      "Very hard class. Lectures are perfect - every word matters. Tests are difficult. Programming labs are very doable but require a lot of thinking. Professor is great - easy to understand, well prepared, and really interesting. If you study, you will do well in this class. If you don't, you won't. It's that simple. Luv this prof.",
      "Great professor. His lectures are so interesting and well thought out. Really enjoyed his class.",
      "pretty difficult class, but this professor is always looking to help out his students",
      "Class is 30% PAs, 30% midterm, 40% Final. Lenient as he modified the final to replace the midterm, and for 1 PA to have reduced weight. PAs are short in terms of lines, but concept-heavy. He podcasts ( 2 - 2.5x is still listenable). Lecture is informative, conceptual, and has some dry humor. Exams are MC and fair, but a bit hard.",
      "He knows you know the question. And I realized I do. As long as you know what you are doing, you should be fine. PA3 is the most time consuming in my opinion. Then PA2, PA4, PA1. Not bad.",
      "a nice lovely humorous professor who loves to help students out. Exams are 70%, all MC, bases on memorization though, and you really need at least a B+ understand to answer the questions. PAs are quite difficult but 35% of the class got full credit. ... a good intro to op system.",
      "The most challenging but useful class so far! The PAs requires a lot of thinkings but are very well designed and really helps to understand the abstract materials about OS. Professor is really clear but people end it up watching Podcast at home and do 2x the speed. Exams are all multiple choice. You will be a much better programmer after this class",
      "Hardest course Ive ever taken, period. Material is extremely challenging. Professor Pasquale is excellent, always comes perfectly prepared to class and brings a lot of energy to lectures. Wants you to learn and fun to listen to (love the white hair)! I feel like Im learning something important and useful, even deep, preparing me for life.",
      "I cannot wait till the quarter ends. He is the best professor I've ever seen and I really really enjoy his class! So many cool knowledge to learn and he is a super cool person too!",
      "Highly recommend you take this class with him. Excellent lecturer and a nice person. Everything you need to know is on the slides. Programming assignments are difficult but the TAs are great for this class. The exams are AP level multiple choice and require you knowing his lecture slides inside and out. This class is tough but it is also forgiving",
      "Dr. Pasquale completely rocks. I don't think there is any teacher who puts more thought into his lectures. He is clear, extremely knowledgeable and fun to listen to. Yes, the class is hard. I'm not going to be getting the best grade, but I don't care. I am much smarter than I was at the beginning of the quarter.",
      "Love love love Prof Pasquale! Learned more from him than all my other profs combined. What more can I say!",
      "Best prof I've had at UCSD, period. Ties the material to the foundations of math and computer science in a way that makes it really interesting. I totally felt I was getting a unique perspective, and feel really lucky I took this class with Pasquale. He's funny too.",
      "Amazing professor, one of the best I have ever had. Very well organized.",
      "Lectures are the clearest I've had at UCSD. Learned a lot from the programming assignments. Tests are multiple choice, but impossible if you don't know the stuff (and still not easy if you do). Matt the TA was great. My one complaint: give more partial credit for programs. One of my programs almost worked (like 90%), but I got only half credit.",
      "This is the prof to learn OS from.",
      "Crystal clear lectures. Tough class. Learned a lot.",
      "Pasquale is VERY COOL. I needed a lot of help and made lots of use of his office hours. He's really nice - treats you with respect. Oh - and he's really funny too.",
      "THE BEST, Pasquale is a model professor. If you could only take one class at UCSD, take his. I graduated many years ago, and I still refer to his notes (the only ones I still have)!!! The other thing I remember is that he expected a lot from us, but he treated us like adults, with respect. My only regret: I wish I took his grad class.",
      "Great class. lf you want to learn about operating systems, this is the definitive class taught by the master Prof. Pasquale. Not an easy class, but worth it! Be ready for some advanced programming that you won't learn anywhere else. Wish I had taken other classes with this prof. Tests are tough.",
      "One of the best classes in CSE, but tough if you want to do well. Pasquale is the master of operating systems. Knows the stuff inside out and knows how to teach. A real professor. Will go the extra mile with you if you need help. The programming projects were really interesting. Warning: Sign up early for his class - it fills up super quick.",
      "Absolutely the best professor I've had at UCSD. Pasquale is prepared, has a deep understanding of the material, and is an excellent (clear) lecturer. Good guy, respects students. Not an easy class, but not impossible either. Programs make you think hard, but are not long. Exams were somewhat tricky, but fair. His lecture notes are worth gold.",
      "If you could just stay awake in class and listen for once in your college career, this should be the class you do it. Everything else is cake.",
      "He is an alright teacher not bad, not great. Learn your crap n leave.",
      "Granted, it was a freshman seminar, he's enthusiastic about what he does, and it rubs off. He's a good man, and it helps that he knows what he's talking about, lacking though he may be in oratorical eloquence (i.e. he can hesitate to finish sentences while searching for the right word)."

His assignments arent as coding heavy but they usually involve other work such as creating graphs/answering conceptual questions. I learned a lot in his class and I hope to take him again in the future.",
      "He is amazing and he really cares about students. An almost perfect professor. The class is easy as well. Just take his as long as you can.",
      "Professor Politz is an amazing professor. He kept everyone engaged in class, and allowed us to discuss codes on our own during class. He was also very approachable which made it easier to ask questions during class and to go to his office hours.",

Really engaging, uses clicker questions for participation. Homework assignments could be tough but always fair. Great class.",

      "Joe is such an amazing person and great lecturer. His lectures are engaging and made coming to 9 AM lecture not a problem. He redesigned the CSE 131 such that we are using Ocaml to write the compiler for a language we design from scratch. Spend 15 - 20 hrs a week but you really learn a lot from this class. 100% recommended!",
      "Joe is a great guy and amazing lecturer! The way he explained complicated data structures and memory management was really creative and made a lot of sense. A couple of his PAs were overly work-intensive but all-around, I really enjoyed his class and would definitely recommend him as a professor!",
      "Never have I felt an instructor so genuinely care about his students the way Joe does. I don't really care for data structures/sorting algorithms but I still enjoyed this course. Definitely try to take a class from Joe while your at UCSD, profs like this are few and far between. PAs are conceptually challenging but don't take up your whole week!",
      "He is an awesome teacher, and actually somehow manages to make cs lectures entertaining. He also puts real effort into the Programming assignments and they are always interesting and fun to do. Definitely take him if you can",
      "Professor Politz is a great lecturer! Made coming to early morning lectures interesting. Also, very reasonable with workload, he did not give us PA's on weeks when we had midterms. Overall one of the best professor's I've had.",

He gives you the answers to in class quizzes as long as you ask (he'll encourage you to), and the top 2 (out of 4) lab quizzes are taken (meaning you can stop going to lab since the first 2 quizzes are pretty easy). Homework gets tough though.",
      "He is very VERY nice. Messed up on a few classes but still got a good grade. Definitely take him!!!!",

      "Just had him for winter quarter. \"Easy\" if you spend legit time doing the 2 projects. Need that expensive book to get anything done. Did poorly on most of Lab quizzes because I never read the book. I got through by mainly following the example problems. For the projects, I just combined a bunch of modified example problems.",
      "Yes...compared to other professors at UCSD, he is pretty easy. The coursework is still time consuming though, and there is a quiz every class day on most days. He will give you the answers if you ask for them though. You have to read the text and do two projects. Both are time consuming, especially the projects.",

You can be done with most of the work by 4th wk. Grading is based on place on list so even if you get 90 you might get a B. But for sure you wont fail if you attend half the class and do projects.",

Why&#63; Because when you take the quiz, you can raise your hand and ask the professor what the answer is. And he will tell you. Your grade is determined by your homework and project grades--there is no final.",

      "This has got to be the easiest class ever. He only counts your top scores to make your grade. (8/12 quizzes 2/4 lab quizzes and 5/10 homework) after that the class is basically over. The only other grades are 2 programming projects which are really easy and if you continue going class he says he'll make sure you get an A. Very easy take if you can.",

SUCH A NICE GUY! if u need this for a GE take it!!!he only takes the top 8 out of 12 quizzes and 2 out of 4 h.w.'s, so if u ace all of that (which if u don't u should be at state) then u don't have to come to class after that!!! such a trip!",

      "Extremely nice, caring, and a genuine genius (google him). Probably the fairest tests I have ever taken, which means if you study with a real intention to get an A you will get an A. Slipped up on first midterm (literally failed) but aced the second and final and got an A in the class. Course is interesting and useful.",

And, tests were extremely fairrelatively easy (cheat sheets). Go to lecture because there is (kind of) no book, and no slides. Plus, he's got his own Wiki page :-)",
      "Probably the nicest professor ever.",

      "One of the greatest professors of all times! This man is a genius who finds ways to entertain the class while lecturing. You will learn a lot from this man! His test are very easy as well. As long as you do his homework and practice finals and midterms, you are expecting an A for the class! Do yourselves a favor and take Grahams!",
      "Do yourself a favor and either go to his lectures or listen to the podcasts. The textbook sucks and you will be hard pressed to find good material on the subject online. Other than that, pretty easy class. The final was 65% of the grade, but it was easy. Came out with an A+ and I never went to class - I just listened to his podcasts.",
      "Fantastic class! Lectures are a bit long at the beginning but pick up after the first two weeks. His genius really shines through, and anyone who was bored wasn't paying attention! The card trick on the last day blew my mind. He really puts a lot of effort into his lectures, and it definitely shows.",
      "Graham is one of those rare professors who can translate their genius into a language undergraduates can actually understand. He'll basically tell you what exactly will be on the midterms/final, so listen up because he's pretty soft-spoken. His lectures can be a bit bland, but he totally made it up by performing a cool card trick the last lecture.",
      "Class is very straightforward and easy, although the hw are somewhat challenging, the midterms and finals are simple since they are based off the hw and practice final, don't read the text book, just go to every lecture, overall easy A",
      "I failed his first midterm, got A+ on second one and 100% on final, end up with an A+, he definitely grades slightly biased. He is a great professor, very interesting in lectures. therefore the lectures are a must-go. textbooks are useless. overall i would recommend this professor as one of my best professors at ucsd.",
      "He is easy!!! and great prof!!!(if u understand homework, u r ready to get an A!!)",
      "Great lecturer. He added a second midterm this quarter. Exams were relatively difficult and the final had some nasty problems (but this could be partly due to the TA). It's better if you have the time to put into it; I didn't and that wasn't very beneficial.",
      "He's obviously one of the most brilliant people you'll ever meet, which is why it's surprising that he's a good lecturer, as well. Grading is 30%/70% midterm/final, but he posts sample exams which are exactly like the real ones. Only the most basic parts of the material are covered, so it's overall a very easy course. The book is cheap, but dense.",
      "He's enthusiastic about Discreet Math in a weird way, and describes the concepts pretty well. Prof. Graham has a crazy good grasp of what he's teaching (the dude invented Graham's number, for goodness' sake!) and regularly brings in extra credit concepts or $1000 proofs for anyone with the balls to solve them. Great guy, good teacher.",
      "Cool teacher. Very clear and not completely boring.",
      "His class is great. Lectures were totally clear. I only went to half of them and I still got the material (struggled a bit on hw, probably better to go to all lectures so you don't have to struggle with the book)",
      "The thing I like about the class is that Graham is a great mathematician and he has control of the concepts. It's very easy to take effective notes by his lecture style, but like any course HW and DI are the most helpful.",
      "Interesting class. Lectures seemed to fall apart at the end, but he was cool and realized that, so he didn't test us on it in the final. Google him and discover that under his grandfatherly charm lies a dark, mysterious past..",
      "Stanford has Knuth, Caltech has Feynman, and UCSD has Graham. He is the best: a genius among the stars, a caring professor, and most of all, an excellent lecturer.",
      "Very nice teacher with an interesting personality. Cares to help the students. His midterms/final are pretty similar to the homework.",
      "Textbook: sucks like crazy; do not buy! (jk :P) Professor: a sage; a great man with many telents and secrets of a glorious past. The class: complicated and uninviting. Basically, something you got to go through as a CS major. But Graham will make the passage slightly better. Recommended.",
      "Graham is a great professor that spends his time to clearly explain and example all the material. The book is near useless compared to his lectures. Exams are fair and pretty much representative of the homework. He makes the material interesting by connecting them with topics like gambling.",
      "I can honestly say Graham was the best teacher I've ever had. He actually compels students to go to class because his fluid and articulate lectures make the rather horrid text, useless. He emphasizes discrete probability and applies it in such a way that even the exams become fun (often pertains to gambling). Hes in the Guinness Book...",
      "If you can take this professor, TAKE HIM. Not because it is a fairly easy class but because he is quite possibly one of the best teachers here. Don't believe me&#63; Take his class, you'll figure it out soon enough."

      "Does a great job at organizing the material in a digestible way, the first midterm was a breeze, the second was dramatically harder and the final was exceptionally hard",
      "Janine is simply one of the best professors to take, her lectures are highly polished and the course materials extremely well-tailored to teach what could otherwise be difficult materials. She also holds amazing office hours where her passion for the subjects really shines through and students all seem to come out with very detailed understanding",
      "Her lecture is super clear and detailed. All the podcasts and slides are posted online. The group homework is pretty hard but if you spend time in office hours it wont be that hard since the TA and profs will explain all the problems pretty clear. Got full score on all group HW. 98% and 100% on 2 midterms and 95% on final. Hard work required.",
      "Janine is super clever and really good at lecturing. Her lecture notes is crystal clear and those are all she wants you to know for exams. We usually have two homework per week, individual one and group one. Individual ones are pretty straightforward and help us review for the basic concept for that topic. Group ones are challenging yet helpful.",
      "Here's a concept,,,A professor who teaches you the material you need to learn and then tests you on that material!!! Ord and Gillespie could learn a ton by taking by taking one of Janine's class!! Seriously though great prof, great lecutures, very clear on what she want's 95% of the time and the 5% of the time that she isn't, she happliy explains!",
      "Although she did give frequent short HWs per week, they helped a lot in keeping up with class material. Explains things really well and discusses important points. On the same frequency as students. Puts in a lot of effort (Saturday office hours. She knows locations of some problems by heart. Piazza). Lighthearted as well. I definitely recommend :)",
      "The most responsible professor I have met ever! Her lecture is so clear which helps you understand the tough stuff a lot. The professor tried her best to answer each question on piazza that there is always no unanswered questions left. All the exams are fair enough if you take effort.",
      "Straight up, best professor I have had for any CSE class I've been in. Her lectures are amazing, and she really takes the time to explain things. SHE IS AMAZING.",
      "I heard that CSE105 is one of the most challenging undergrad course before I take it. Janine is clear and her slides are also clear, so 105 is like of normal difficulty. She gives HW after every lecture to keep students not falling behind, though it is kind of annoying to do HW all the time. Midterm is easier than the practice ones. Great overall",
      "CSE21 was a really tough class for me, but taking it with her made it much better! Her lectures are very clear and thorough, and you really should attend them all. The HW assignments are very difficult but there are so many office hours to use, make sure you attend hers!!! The exams are all very fair for what is covered. Tough class, great prof.",
      "Lectures well and is committed to her students",
      "CSE 21 is a pain, but it's slightly less of a pain with prof. Tiefenbruck. She lectures clearly and has good coverage. Reading the book is a necessity, and studying hard is required. As a professor she is excellent, but the class is difficult in and of itself.",
      "I couldn't find a professor in UCSD who is more responsible and caring for the students. She definitely knows how to teach, her lectures are engaging and really really helpful. She holds 2 hours of office hour in the WEEKEND in which she goes over almost all the homework problem. The best professor in UCSD ever!!!",
      "This class was hard for me. I made the mistake of using combinations instead of permutations on the 2nd test and failed it hard. I also misread a question. She is a pretty good lecturer, I wouldn't advise missing class. The tests were as hard as the homework, which was really hard. I didn't fail thanks to a generous curve.",
      "The material covered throughout the quarter is very interesting, but the homework takes plenty of time to do and does not prepare you for the exams. I put a lot of time into the class, and even after preparing myself for a week for the final exam and understanding the practice final exam, it was not enough; it is impossible to know what to expect.",
      "She's from the math department but she's really into the material from cse21. A solid clear lecturer; never heard her say \"umm.\" Homework is challenging but can be done in groups of 3.",
      "She's a strong lecturer, very clear and makes concepts easy to understand.",
      "She's pretty much the hottest teacher I've ever had, ever. Also super smart. The class is combined with Russel's class so they're the same tests. Only class I've taken here where they don't let you use a sheet of notes on the exams. Homework is really long and hard. Exams aren't quite so awful. Expect to do a lot of work in this class.",
      "Janine is pretty great. Very enthusiastic about the material, goes at a reasonable pace. Very helpful during her office hours as well. Definitely recommend!"

      "Going to class isn't required, but you have to understand the lecture slides to do well. Go to labs, do the homework, and memorize commands! Course material is boring except for shell scripting. Not a bad lecturer, but I hated the class and the content; total waste of time when we can look up vim and Unix commands in &lt; 1 second.",
      "Teaches with good intentions to cover a lot of topics and debuggers. A lot of content that can easily fly over your heads. The lectures aren't mandatory, but understand the slides for the labs (which are mandatory). Be prepared for the scripting project - hardest part of the course. Get decent on the midterm/final and you'll be fine.",
      "Assignments are super easy, lectures are pretty pointless to go to (just look at the slides afterwards), labs are pretty boring. Other than the scripting project at the end, this course doesn't really have all that much difficulty to it",
      "Attendance isn't mandatory. She uses clickers, but that's just for class engagement. So don't be fooled thinking you have to go to class. The course material itself it pretty boring; didn't find anything really useful except some scripting. Overall, she's not a bad lecturer. I just absolutely hated the class and its content; total waste of time.",
      "Ilkay is charming and caring. The subject material is a bit dry but she explains it well. The midterm was based heavily off of the study guide and lectures! Just ay attention and review the guide and you'll be fine.",
      "She was good in her lectures. Although you don't really need to attend any for CSE15L to get an A. Maybe attend the ones before the midterm/final. The labs are what your grade will be based on and she controls none of that.",
      "Compared to Gary (I've attended 2 of his lectures) she seems much more clear, focused, and prepared for class. What I liked least about this class was the labs. I really enjoyed working with a partner but I the labs could have been written better and the quizzes could be better at testing your knowledge rather than your ability to memorize.",
      "Easy to pass, but not really easy to get an A. This class need a lot of memorization. Overall, Dr. Altintas is a good lecturer, and her slides help a lot.",
      "I stopped showing up to her classes when I realized they weren't essential to passing. All you have to do is make sure you know the slides super well for the weekly quizzes, midterm, and final. I'd recommend making some flashcards for studying purposes. I thought she was a decent person as well. Overall, don't worry too much about this class",
      "She's amazing and she will help you if you go talk to her but honestly you don't need to attend lecture to get an A in this class. Just memorize and study lecture slides for midterm and final. She's known for reusing midterm questions on the final.",
      "Go talk to her! She runs a research group at SDSC and is super cool!",
      "Annoying class, but not because of the lectures/lecturer. Those are completely fine and pleasant to attend. The labs and lab quizzes (at end of each lab) are ridiculous though, as they are almost like trivia/fun-fact style quizzes; the answers are to recall. The 2 midterms are fairer. 50% MT and 50% lab scores. Brownie points for good memory",
      "She translates difficult computer science concepts to non-CS majors with ease. Her slides present the material in bite-sized chunks that build on each other, and in-class discussions promote critical thinking and learning. Lectures are just the right size to thoroughly cover one whole subtopic. You can tell she enjoys helping students and teaching!"

      "She is a good professor but sometimes struggled to finish lecture material. That being said, easy A class, pretty interesting (unless you have prior programming experience). Cynthia Lee is one of my favorites at UCSD.",
      "The mandatory lectures were tedious and she gets caught up answering questions instead of finishing what she planned to cover. She reinforced key points, but it was repetitive. Exam material covered concepts covered in the programming assignments and reading. The discussions are only helpful if you're struggling with the assignments. Easy A.",
      "She's not bad. But it's hard to judge the professors in this course very comprehensively because of the really bad lecture format. But professor Lee was very clear, fun and a good teacher overall.",
      "Great professor!! Lectures were clear and she took the time to explain everything which was really helpful for me as a first-time programmer. Go to class for the clicker points. Both midterms and the final exam were straight from lectures and labs. 1-page cheat sheet for each exam. TAs and tutors were extremely helpful during labs and tutor hours.",
      "Great professor, but the attendance is mandatory.",
      "Great prof! Very flexible and willing to help anyone who puts in the time to succeed. The class is a bit time consuming between the labs and assignments. She also gives participation points using clicker questions so you pretty much have to go to class. The midterms and final are pretty much from the lectures. If you put in the time it is an enjoyable class! The TAs were also awesome! Very helpful and very accessible!",
      "Great prof. I don't know if it was just because it was an introductory type class, but she explained everything thoroughly and in an easy-to-understand manner. She seemed to spend a lot of [her own] time on this class as well. The TAs were also great and helpful. Exams were straight from LE/Labs.",
      "Quite a reasonable class. Didn't find the peer assessment useful though. Lectures were a bit boring but the subject's not my thing. Homeworks were reasonable as were the exams. Probably would have been much harder with another professor, but still learned the material.",
      "One of the best professors in the CSE department. I can see how this material would be difficult with another professor but Professor Lee gives so many examples and her homeworks/exams are very much based on the examples. Even the clicker questions really help you learn and when you go back to study those can be very useful. Overall, excellent prof",
      "Very enthusiastic. Programming assignments are well-tuned in terms of difficulty and time required. Exams are somewhat difficult, but the is a very generous curve, especially if you do well on the PA's. Some students didn't like her lecture pacing and explanations (I had no problems), but she's probably loads better than Burkhard! I recommend her.",
      "Very good professor. Is willing to help anyone succeed in the class. Quizzes, midterm, and final reflect the homework problems. She even makes CSE 20 fun, and offers &quot;extra credit&quot; as well. Highly recommend.",
      "Very upbeat professor, who enjoys teaching. Sometimes can be a bit goofy, but she is sweet. Be prepared for quizzes by staying on top of your homework. Midterm and Final are well-related to homework, and lecture notes. A very fair professor. Sometimes she gave out post-cards, and/or candy for participation."

It also stood out to me that he enthusiastically spent time interacting with students, personally providing help and very interesting insights during lab sessions.",
      "Homework is due on one day and there's a quiz on the other. The material is a bit difficult, but his lectures are good and the final grade is curved. I had an 80% but it turned out to be a B+. Spend ample time on the homework and pay attention in lectures.",
      "Rhodes is a good prof his lecture is a clear and he gives good examples. Beyond that this class is awful, I chose CSE as my major not math, doing proofs every weeks sucks, you spend a ton of time doing hard math proofs that 99% of the class will never look at again. Class is a total waste of time.",

Algorithms is a tough course, no matter who you take it with (unless you take prof Hu's notoriously easy 101 course) so it's good to take with a straight-forward & organized prof like Neil.",
      "I had Prof. Rhodes for CSE 20 and 21. I was elated that he'll be teaching my 105 class too. I would take every CSE class from him if I could. He's funny and personable. I think he learned my name by the 3rd week of class, and I don't even really speak up much. Learned a ton from him, excellent prof.",
      "Great lecturer. Fair exam. study and you can get good grade.",
      "Excellent teacher. His lectures are interesting and he has a good teaching style and sense of humor. He puts templates for the notes online that you can print out and then write on in lecture. He gives weekly quizzes taken almost directly from the homework. The exams are challenging but fair.",
      "he is a good prof. the class itself is kinda hard just do the hw and you will do fine in the class. understand what he means by the word PROVE it can be very easy or very hard.",
      "Good Prof. This course was pretty easy and Professor Rhodes did a good job of explaining concepts and helping students. Weekly quizes were straight forward and both the midterm and final were fairly simple. Overall good professor.",
      "He is a pretty good professor, but he has a SERIOUS stick up his ass about style points. Do not have methods that are longer than 10 lines unless it is impossible. Take a good look at the program he gives you to see how he likes the style, and do it EXACTLY. Oh, and if you get a programing assignment called critter dont even bother trying.",
      "I found the lectures to be very boring and monotone. They did not hold my attention very well and that is probably why I struggled in this class (Still recieved a B though). The programming assignments are very hard, I probably spent an average of 8 hrs on each assignment (One assignment took 15 hrs and I got 2 points). He is an &quot;OK&quot; prof.",
      "Struggled with the class at the beginning nearly failing the first midtermbut started studying like crazy and endeup with an A. I worked harder for this class than just about any other but it paid off and I learned so much. Good teacher. Likes students. Explains material well through slides with tablet pc. Overall recommended prof.",
      "best cs 20/21 prof out there. speaks well and explains the subject with enthusiasm and clarity of subject. very approachable and is more than willing to help you outside of class. weekly quizzes help boost grade and somewhat force you to keep on top of the material. 2 MTs lower one worth 15 higher one worth 25. Quizzes worth 20, final 40. No curve.",
      "Awesome teacher! Very helpful. Straight up 90-80-70, no curve, but overall a very easy class.",
      "Very easily-structured class. Homework assigned each class; quiz next time taken DIRECTLY off the homework (numbers the same!); exams based on the quizzes and homework. As he said, &quot;If you do all the problems... I can't see how you could fail to get an A&quot;. Rhodes is helpful in office hours and really cares about his students. Highly recommended."

      "Fantastic professor!!! Against recommendations, I took this class with no programming experience whatsoever and ended up with a B+. This is easily the hardest class I've ever taken, but I learned so much from it and I would take it again in a heartbeat. If you have the option, take him!!!",
      "Highly helpful. He will answer all questions on piazza. However, be prepared to dedicate a fair amount time on programming and reading if you are a beginner in computer science.",
      "Clearly passionate about what he's teaching and honestly not that hard if you pay attention in class and read. Lectures were clear and his assignments were reasonable. I've never had any coding experience but his class was definitely doable. Probably one of the best professors I've had at UCSD and I'm really glad I had him for my first coding class",

His homework assignments are pretty tough because he doesn't review syntax in depth, but once you get the hang of things, it gets easier. Grading criteria is never obvious, but I'm pretty sure assignments were curved. He is more helpful than TAs for sure.",
      "Dr Papadopoulos was extremely helpful and was always willing to explain specifics. Lectures were slightly long, but were interesting. He spent time discussing the programming assignments in lecture, and even showed us code fragments required for the homework assignments. He was also always willing to go over material again if things were unclear.",
      "He is a very nice guy. I can safely say that I am a much better programmer than I was when I first walked into that class. It was long and hard. You absolutely need to ask for help and not give up. Make sure to have time for this class. There were 2 extra credit quizzes to help you out on points lost on the assignments and the final.",
      "Great guy, super helpful. His programs are hard but you learn a lot from it. Lectures are interesting, but too bad nobody like to attend morning classes. You get a lot of extra credits to make up mistakes in programming assignment.",
      "Great guy. Don't know how hard Ord was, but despite hard programming assignments pulled an A with limited CSE background, and not too much time commitment.",
      "I should say if I take Ord's class it would be a lot easier for me, but that doesn't mean Pro. Papadopoulos is not a good professor. Although homework and exams might be hard and tricky for beginners, professor is very helpful in his office hour. If you have past programming experience, I think you can handle it and learn things from his class."

      "Pros: lecture notes, lab material &amp; solution posted, top lecture experience, super nice and patient personality, extra credits, allow lowest scores of lab and quiz to drop, easy material Cons: reading quiz plus I hate moodle, attendance I guess",
      "He is so good at explaining course materials. His explanations are always the simples, comprehensible, and helpful. He lets students fill out surveys in order to give out extra credit on midterm and final. His final is a little harder than the midterm, but definitely doable. His PSAs are not that hard. Amazing and patient. Definitely recommend him.",
      "Very clear in lecture and care about students. He wants students to feel comfortable in his class.",
      "CSE141 itself is a pretty boring class but Prof. Porter did a fairly great job in presenting the materials. The problem with his teaching is that he sometimes talks too fast that you don't understand! I find that you learn better by just watching podcast at home. The homework is pretty time consuming and exams are pretty fair.",
      "PA is easy, about &lt;14 hours each week and the exams are also easy. Anyway easy A class but you will also learn a lot",
      "My favorite CSE prof! He took the time to make class surveys and analyze/act upon the results. Going to class was not mandatory, but I attended because I had fun in class. His in class activities are helpful. Overall just a great guy.",
      "Prof. Porter is amazing! He really cares about students and education. One of my favorite classes from UCSD. Do go to lectures or watch podcasts. Do iClicker questions and homework. If you understand them, you will do fine on midterm and final. Plus, Prof. Porter works with amazing teaching staffs! Would definitely recommend:)",
      "Prof Porter really cares about his students. Reading isn't needed at all and you don't have to go to class, it's video podcasted. You do get some participation for going which otherwise is part of your grade on the final. Midterm was fairly easy (85% average), homework is average difficulty, and final had a 69% average but a pretty solid curve.",
      "Very solid professor to take this class with. Really respect him as a teacher. He makes it look easy. His homework assignments are reasonable and gives you enough time to do them. His exams are very fair. As for the reading quizzes, I barely opened the book for them. You can do well in this class by reviewing the slides and the homework",
      "Prof. Porter's CSE 141 is very, very fair. He gives a nice curve at the end, and I learned a lot. The homework wasn't too bad. Just do it and show up while clicking in, and you're golden. :D",
      "UCSD found a a very good professor here. Porter is very reasonable and makes it clear what is expected of the class. He teaches the material well and really wants you to understand it. Programming assignments can be tough and quizzes will kick your butt at times, but the midterm and final are quite fair if you studied. Take him.",
      "Great prof. Take him over any other prof for 8B (including Ord).",
      "No slip days!!!!",
      "He is new! The assignment and quiz for this class is tough though. But his class is really helpful and you can learn a lot from it. If you attend every lecture and did the programming assignment carefully the A is easy. Textbook really helpful. The student respected him a lot. By the way the TA is really hot......"

      "One of the best teachers at UCSD. I found him more enterntaining then Sorin as he will make comments that are unexpected. Such as a compiler barfing, etc... Taken during Winter 2009, had a midterm and final instead of quizzes. Very fair course but make sure to start PA's early. Python is awesome.",
      "Great sense of humor. I feel that he lectures better than Sorin. This class is one of the most skill-oriented of the CS courses; it basically builds your skill in functional programming (which is awesome--hooray for Ocaml!). Prolog is weird. The later programming assignments take a lot of time, so start early.",
      "Great prof! Stuff is well-explained but PA's are on the slightly more difficult side but def doable. Final was pretty hard! I took this WI '06 and got a B when I probably deserved a D, but he was very generous with the curve. I don't know if this is normal because we had a diff prof for the 1st half and he sucked - prolly was making up for that",
      "Jhala is a bit hard but his class is quite entertaining. He adds humor to the class to make time go a bit quicker. He curves big time so don't stress out too much.",
      "one of the easier classes I've taken. Didnt go to lectures except to take quizzes...interesting teacher, fair. Final and quizes could get tricky but he curves so... programming assginments might take a bit of time but they're okay. With a tad bit of effort you should get an A",
      "Ranjit was a really funny guy and had good lectures. He was way too tough though on the assignments and the final. 130 is supposed to be an easy class, espcially since you dont really learn anything in it (besides the fact that ML is a crappy programming language) but Ranjit made the assignments too tough.",
      "Ranjit is a cool, funny guy. But if you take 130 with him, you'll probably end up doing more work than with other professors that teach it. Programming assignments took about 2-3 days each. An additional day may be required if you really want to bullet proof your code. There were quizzes every week, but lowest ones are dropped. Final was tough"

      "This is a very challenging (thus time consuming) course that involves lots of proofs. Hovav is a very good lecturer. If you do all the exercises and at least half the 'problems' in the 'problems' section of sipser you should be prepared for the exams (won't necessarily get A, but you should do good relative to average).",
      "If you are looking at this, then just turn back and look else where... That's my advice.",
      "Hardest thing I've ever done",
      "Shacham is a great professor, but the class was terrible. He insisted on us using Haskell for homework because he felt that we'd understand the concepts better and write better proofs. As a math major, I spend most of my time writing proofs. Knowing Haskell ability to write proofs. Also, he totally butchered Cantor's diagonal argument. Twice.",

Highly recommend you complete 120, 131, and some web programming (134B, 135, 132A, 136) to truly appreciate everything this class has to offer. Hopefully in the future they'll add a Computer Security cluster!",

      "Lecture is super clear but the problem sets are really hard. Discussion section is useless since the TAs confuse you (give hints that is not relevant to the problem sets). He curves generously.",
      "Excellent professor. Lectures straight out of the book. Crystal clear... except when it comes to what's expected on problem sets. Just hope your TA isn't \"Ming the merciless\", he's probably the worst TA of all time. Gives 0's/100 with no explanation and is incredibly OCD about proof format. Shacham's fantastic, though.",
      "This is definitely a harder version of 127 but you learn so much about security. I got through most of CSE without using gdb, but here I finally understood it. The assignments are fairly difficult but once you get them, you feel accomplished. Midterm and final are short answer and test your thinking abilities but the curve is fair."

Normally when there are grading issues, certain profs *cough Gary* will deduct you for questioning him but Gao goes through each case to ensure fairness and accuracy.",
      "My first time rating a prof on this website because I'm just that satisfied with this professor. Literally the most chill, down-to-earth professor I've had so far. He's super approachable so don't be afraid to talk to him like you are with your other professors. Not only is the class easy as long as you keep up, you learn a ton of cool stuff too.",

He deeply cares for the learning of his students and is accessible at 3 am in the night (And it doesn't have to be academics). He structures the class such that students can take out as much as they put into it.",
      "Prof Gao is really nice! He DEFINITELY cares about students. He won't push us to do things, but if we're interested in something, he will always give us support and help. And he always shares some interesting materials to us to read. He is the best professor I've ever had:)) BTW he is super cool. Looks cool too.",
      "Professor Gao is the best professor in UCSD. Absolutely take his class and you will learn many interesting stuffs. He gives a lot of extra credits and even if you miss one assignment, you will probably still get an A. His lectures are clear and the lectures are podcasted so you can always go back and review.",
      "Honestly, Sicun is truly the best. Have a question in the middle of night? He probably will answer it. If you failed the class, you must have failed yourself. The professor holds up his end, he makes everything clear and concise. Don't understand something? No problem. He will answer your question to your heart's content. He is THE best professor",
      "Sicun is the best professor in UCSD. He is sooooooooo smart and nice to students. Always accessible outside class and answer emails and questions immediately. Definitely take his class again!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

His lectures are incredibly helpful as well as funny, never a dull moment in class so you'll definitely pay attention. On cs241 the assignments are hard but Troy is incredibly active on Piazza and always available on office hours to give feedback. Exams are pretty fair",
      "Just one word: Awesome!",
      "great prof.",
      "Really great prof. He explains class material very clearly, and he is very humorous. The class loves him. And in general a very nice person.",
      "Has very good humour, and can explain concepts using it.",
      "Pretty good and humor Very clear",
      "Amazing professor. Clear, consistent, concise. Uses skeleton notes; you better show up to class to get the annotated versions. He really walks you through the content and you get a thorough understanding of how compilers work. The only course I have made EVERY effort to attend! 1010, all my female friends have crushes on him. Some guys do too!",
      "Troy is an incredible human being! He's good at teaching, knows the material, and treats students with respect. Thank you Dr. Vasiga.",
      "He is a great prof, and so coooooool!",
      "Awesome dude, explains really well and clearly. Speaks very slowly so all international students can understand as well. Overall 910. Despite the course being hard, Troy did a great job.",
      "Best prof i've ever met",
      "Don't ask what is wrong with the world. Just find the good thing and ignore the rest. In the last lecture, Troy said this to us.",
      "he is simply the bst...!",
      "The way that Troy lectures is really interesting and coherent and it changes my view of computer science. Computer Science can be a very very interesting course and it is not that challenging as I thought before I take CS 135. Thank you, Troy! You are a good teacher, indeed.",
      "Very active enthusiastic engaging, really what university profs should be. In terms of the course, I hate it :) But one of the best profs.",
      "BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!!! I wish I could have him as my teacher forever.",
      "He\u2019s an AMAZING prof! He explains the material very well. He\u2019s funny, and always keeps the class intrigued. He took a course that could have potentially been boring and dry, and made it interesting. If you aren\u2019t in his section I recommend switching into it!",
      "By far the best CS prof you will ever encounter. Enthusiastic, humouress - all you can ask for from a prof.",
      "Best teacher i ever had",
      "He is very clear. He was my favorite professor that term. Also he was really helpful after class and he answer all the questions in the class online discussion page!",
      "Very thorough and clear with his explanations. Friendly and willing to help, so long as you ask. Even though the course material is super dry, he makes it interesting with his humour. Excellent prof!",
      "His classes are so interesting and it is easy to understand.. i like him so much!",
      "awesomeeee prof! The course I look forward to the most!",
      "Great prof, really clear in his lectures. Funny guy and always hints to the solutions of the assignments and to what kinds of questions will be in the midterm. Go to his lectures and you should do well.",
      "Great",
      "He is a great teacher!! I thought my CS115 prof was good enough but he is better! He teaches in a slow way which can make everyone follow him and his classes are interesting as well.",
      "I took his cs115 in winter 2012,and I fount he maybe the best prof I have ever seen in UW. explain every step on the course notes very clearly. although cs115 is a simple course, bad prof can make the simple stuff difficult. but he can make difficult stuff easier and easy stuff to be more easier. you would definetly love his class.",
      "Awesome teacher.",
      "Great prof. Very entertaining and clear. Also a DILF.",
      "Great professor! He makes you laugh and gives really good notes and great holistic idea of what you're actually doing as well as a specific one. Funnest class of my semester for sure.",
      "Really interesting and funny lectures, nice explanations. He supports Ubuntu too much though)",
      "highly recommend to attend his class, so much fun and get a good grade",
      "He is a very smart prof. I did not find anything special about him other than his smartness.(this is because all CS prof at waterloo are amazing) He follows the slides and explan everything well. He is smart enough to answer our problems using simple logic. We are able to find him outside of classroom and he'll answer our problems.",
      "This guy is AWWEEESOMEEE! Definitely take his section, he explains almost every detail in his class. Furthermore, he creates desire to do cs. I do not remember any class that he didn't make fun of sth. Don't even think about any other prof; take his section, you won't regret.",
      "one of the best very helpful in explaining and when he explains he is very logical asks students alot of question during class to see if were paying attention which show he cares about his students and also has funny jokes the best!! take his class",
      "He's one of the best professors one can get in UW along with Jock McKay(the stat teacher). Maybe he's even better. Very fun class, learned a lot. I didn't miss one of his class for the entire term, not by discipline, but I can't miss. If I broke my leg this morning I'd still go to his class in the afternoon.",
      "Great prof. funny.",
      "Funny, great sense of humor, interesting, engaging, helpful",
      "Great prof. Easily one of the most engaging profs ive had",
      "He is the BEST instructor I have ever had. Without him, I can't image how boring CS241 will be. He is not only humor but also &quot;hit the bush&quot; in class. Take his class, you will learn a lot.",
      "Great prof. Teaches extremely well, but sometimes hard to understand in the middle of his jokes. Otherwise, one of the best profs.",
      "Excellent lecturer. Keeps students engaged. Absolutely hilarious jokes. Keep up the good work!",
      "Amazing. Kept me awake, really helped me take everything in and understand it and he made it fun to come to class. Good job, Troy!",
      "Not only can he maintain student's interest in the topic, he makes the learning process fun ^^. A real gem in the CS faculty.",
      "Great prof!!! Made everything crystal clear. If you ever had trouble, he'd be willing to help. Funny guy but watch out if your cell phone rings in class!",
      "He's very funny while teaching and seems nice but when you're one-on-one with him he's a bit of a jerk. Overall his teaching is very clear and it makes CS more understandable. Even though Scheme is lame, he makes it ok.",
      "excellent",

      "His lectures were always full of practical examples that made following the content easy. He has a &quot;lets explore&quot; attitude when solving problems, which is really important for CS. Very approachable during class and office hours, knew my name in the first week when I didn't even remember telling him!",
      "Really funny prof who really cares about students. He dedicated a lot of time outside of class to helping students. Always a fair marker and was willing to explain anything you had questions about",
      "J.P. made the class -- Math 135 -- easier to understand and interesting to follow. You can tell that he truly cares about the subject, and about the students he is teaching. I would highly encourage you to take him for his class. I would also highly encourage participating in class. The more questions you ask, the more both you and he are engaged.",
      "J.P is awesome. If he didn't go into math he would probably have a career as a public speaker - that's how energetic and engaging his lectures are. The course itself was not always an easy one but he made it interesting and understandable.",
      "Absolutely the best Math 135 instructor of Waterloo!",
      "BEST. PROF. EVER! great explanations, humour, and help. the course is tough though",

      "JP was a great lecturer and made everything super clear. My only complaint would be his availability, whenever I went to office hours they were so crowded I barely got 5 minutes with him. He also seems to jump all over the place, its like his mind is racing 100 miles a minute. Would highly suggest attending his lectures though.",
      "He is excellent teacher . today , on 21 April 2016 he takes class of 11 standard at D.a.v public school in Amritsar. It was amazing experience of my life with him. He teaches very joyfully that it become a great interest in us . Thus he is very amazing as well as nice natured man. love him(;",
      "JP was such a great teacher. He would ask how your day was and made sure you understood the content if he noticed you looked confused in class. His examples and lessons were always spot on with the assignments and he never got behind. I was so lucky to have him. I hope I get him for math or CS next year!",

I still am super bad at the class but I understand so much more now! JP explains everything so well, and he is so enthusiastic iT absolutely makes me day. Love him, if you can get in his class JUST DO IT.",

      "Good and caring!",
      "He helps students adjust to their first year as he teaches. Give a good amount of examples, knows the content he is teaching, doesn't just copy off his notes. Listens to students questions and answer them fairly. Marks fairly but not easily. Great prof for Math 135",
      "He is nice and funny. Notes are organzied and helpful. Good to have this prof.",

      "He was amazing! I would take all possible CS courses with him if it was an option! He cares about you learning but, not so much its creepy. I went to his office on many occasions and he helped me. Great prof made my first year a breeze(the cs part of first year)!",
      "Very good prof. Material was kind of bland but he made it at least a little interesting. Would recommend this prof for CS because his teaching style is very engaging.",

      "Awesome prof! Funny, engaging, and teaches the material well. Always is there to help the students; he's quick at replying to any email questions. I really enjoyed the class, when I was worried I might not. But definitely love it, and lots of thanks to J.P.!",
      "Before his class I hated CS; now I'm thinking of switching my major to it. He's an excellent prof, clearly knows his stuff, and is really good at teaching. Engaging and funny, it's not too hard to pay attention to his lectures. Encourages questions, makes you feel GOOD for asking them, then does his best to find the answer. Very supportive.",
      "Got me interested in computer science. Always willing to help and take the time to answer questions. No complaints whatsoever.",
      "This course is by far my favourite course in university, and part of it was also because of the prof. This prof is just plain amazing! Made me actually want to go to every single class, a great lecturer. I would definitely take more courses with him if I could.",
      "so far this is the only guy I know who teaches 5 different courses(Math 135,136,CS 134,115,241) and maybe even more.I admit he sometimes is arrogant,but most times he is clear and helpful.And extremely passionate in class so I never successfully slept in his class,which,I guess,is good for me.",
      "Words can't describe how good Pretti is. He's one of the amazing CS profs. If you get the chance, don't think twice, and sign up.",

I mean - anyone who says anything bad about this prof is absolutely insane. Consider yourself blessed if you get this man as your teacher.",

      "I am in CS because of this guy. He's awesome. But watch out, his exams a little tough!",
      "This guy is amazing. He was able to relighten the computer programming passion I once had. I was skipping my calc class to go to JP's lecture, since my default CS prof sucked.",
      "Amazing prof. One of the best at UW. I loved his classes and were sad when they were done. Exams are hard, but you can do it :)",

      "Very good prof, very helpful inside/outside of lecture. Got 80s in his class.",
      "Best cs prof ever! Explains things on a level that everyone can understand! Provides the best extra help - makes sure you 'get it' and encourages you! Extremely inspirational - you leave lectures with your mind expanded. BETTER THAN TROY!",

      "take him, u wont regret it",
      "Had him as a guest lecturer for CS 241, by far on of the best. High energy, and he'll go out of his way for you as a student. Don't believe me&#63; See him in his office. Stellar person. Trying for good in this world.",
      "He is a really nice prof, but if you are taking cs241 and should be careful...coz Tory and him will definetely make the midterm and final really hard...and he also will mark the midterm before drop-deadline such that students have time to drop the course.",
      "I'm in 4B, and he is still the best prof I've ever had. Too bad he's a Leafs fan.",
      "Great Prof, makes the hard material easy and intersting. Really helpful if you have problems. All profs should look to him for an example of how a prof should be.",
      "One of the best profs. Always full of energy, and makes you think. He talks non-stop until end of Lec. Always asks you if its ok that he moves on. NEVER bores you. He makes u want to learn more. Jam-packed class. Had to check ID #'s for valid students :)",

Also, he made the course material pretty challenging and way more fun than the regular CS courses. His lecture notes are complete and very helpful. Best class I took in my first year.",
      "Cares so much about being a good teacher it's astounding. He constantly refines his courses and puts effort into ensuring that he presents material in the right way. For example, he does original research in computer science on data structures that are easier to teach than the existing ones. So much respect for him, great prof.",
      "Amazing professor, but you need to put some effort into learning the concepts!",

You wouldn't think it at first, as sometimes his lectures are slightly dull and hard to follow, but he does a great job in terms of challenging his students and is very helpful. Really makes you understand and love functional programming. Take this course if you have the aptitude, it's far more rewarding than CS135/6.",

He didn't teach C at all in the lectures but he stick with Racket and taught us some compiler and assembler stuff. It's pretty hard to understand in first year. He is an amazing prof, funny and very smart.",

His assignments are hard and it gets you to think. He really challenges you to think about CS deeply. His exams are pretty challenging.",

      "Earns his salary. Had 16-page midterm marked for the entire section in three days. Reasonable in expectations. Challenging, but worth it.",
      "CS 145 can be difficult for those without prior mathematical experience. However, if you know what induction and recursion are, and are willing to put in a bit of time, you ought to do well. The professor teaches well and is very nice, but you do need to actually know how to code. Don't expect a trivial course and you'll get a very interesting one.",
      "Good prof, extremely helpful during office hours. Made the course accessible to poeple with no prior experience, yet still interesting for people with lots of experience. Assignments are often very challenging though. Exams were well written.",
      "A brilliant lecturer of a difficult class (but definitely worth it in the end).",
      "Intelligent, friendly guy. Really knows what he's doing. Can be a little unclear, boring, and/or long-winded sometimes.",
      "This guy is hard. Don't take his course unless you are willing to put effort into it. His assignments are very hard. That being said, if you do put in the effort, this might be the most rewarding course you ever take.",
      "Painfully hard, the course still gives me nightmares. At the same time, assignments do a great job of teaching. Very fair on the exams, and does nice bell curves. I think many people got over 100 in this course (the CS geniuses of course), but as long as you stuck around, the mark adjusting helped. Assignments take VERY long and are VERY hard.",
      "good prof, but it takes getting used to his teaching style. The assignments were quite challenging, but at least after you completed it, you felt you had a better grasp of the material. the assignments were hard, but you have to remember this is the University of Waterloo - arguably one of the best CS schools in North America",
      "Very good at teaching scheme. He teaches very fast, which is ideal for an advanced course, but probably very bad for a regular course. I took the course with significant prior knowledge of programming, and I must admit that is was very helpful, despite everyone saying that it's not necessary. Gives a LOT of bonus marks, but also a LOT of work.",
      "Prabhakar has a very unique teaching style unlike any instructor I've had. He teaches the lesson from the ground up, to guide you to recreate and understand the entire picture yourself. Yet at the same time, he gives you all the necessary information in a clear and logical fashion. I've enjoyed every CS 145 lecture so far.",
      "This is the single most dedicated prof at this school, that I have encountered. The level at which he genuinely cares about students is astonishing. This course made me love CS.",
      "this prof's explanations are OK, but could be more straightforward sometimes, instead of using those long sentences and big words. His exams are marked pretty generous, as long as you really show your understanding of the material.",
      "great prof...could be a better lecturer, but his assignments prepare you so well fr the midtrm and the final, that if u end up doing and understanding the assignments (which are hard) yourself, u'll do well in the course...and u actually end up learning something...",
      "One of the most passionate profs I've ever hard. He cares about his performance and how well you learn. He's one of the only profs that will discuss his ratings by students, and takes these ratings very seriously. Also an incredibly bright guy; one of the smartest people I know (in CS, music, travel, etc -- he's a well-rounded guy!)",
      "Very devoted and actually cares about students education. Incredibly helpful to see outside of class and encourages students to do so. Assignments and exams are tough but fair. You'll definately learn a lot. He isn't the best lecturer, but isn't that bad either. If your looking for an easy credit, wrong guy, if you actually want to learn, excellent",
      "Just like so many people here already said: a very, very caring and devoted scholar, a zealot in his own way. Looking forward to see more of him in later courses.",
      "He is truly a genious!. Cares a lot about the students. Midterms are ok, final is impossible! Lack of past exam paper is one of the main reason for not being able to make good prep. for final. But overall, he is a great teacher.!",
      "One of the few profs in Waterloo CS who actually cares about teaching and the underaduate curriculumn. His lectures are often not so clear, but he is very helpful if you go see him outside of class. In upper year classes he has a tendancy to slaughter his students, but if you take a course with him you will learn a lot.",
      "Awesome, really cares about his students, particularly if you care to learn. Definitely worth having as a prof. Take CS 135, don't torture yourself with the ugliness that is Java.",
      "Excellent",
      "Very clear and precise about assignments",
      "Loves his subject",
      "This guy's a freakin genious yo...Definitly know ALOT..I mean ALOT...but only if you like the stuff he's teaching..if you dont it can be a pain..for me it was an amazing experience. hope to have him as a prof for future courses",
      "His style may not be to everyone's taste, but I liked him, both as a prof and as a person. Of all profs I had in 6 terms at Waterloo, he impressed me the most.",
      "No Comments",
      "Though it would be a tragedy for his students to be deprived of the chance to learn from this brilliant man, he so clearly should have been a rock star.",
      "Dude's an evil genius, but a really smart guy in my class told me the secret: the songs he plays before class aren't just songs. They're clues to the test answers. No room here to explain fully, but pay attention to titles and think plain ol' binary code.",
      "This sloe-eyed demon can and will provoke, tempt and cajole the best possible work out of you. Stern, sometimes even forbidding manner, but really just a baa-lamb underneath.",
      "Prabhakar is a vastly underrated prof. I think he's an excellent lecturer, and just because he designs courses so that you have to EARN a good mark instead of getting one by default doesn't make him a bad professor.",
      "AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! Excruciatingly hard exams...Lectures are somewhat engaging, but he often gives overly complicated explanations",
      "I think he is a good prof. He is trying to make students learn the material and not merely getting a high mark without knowing anything. His exams and assignments are tough, but he is always there to help!",
      "Not sure why other people are so against him: he's extremely charismatic, but in an refreshing take-you-out-of-the-boring-box way. I found him engaging and easy to learn from.",
      "Sometimes tries to step back and give a more general view of the material, which is interesting and welcome. Music before class is also nice. However, he does tend to plow through things that could use more explaining.",
      "very charismatic. good taste in music. philosophical. extremely tough exams.",
      "His exams test concepts, not memorization so if you get that, you'll do well.",
      "Very very good in this class. The assignments still give me nightmares",
      "Best prof I had at UW.",
      "Interesting to listen to.",
      "Annoying digressions on music, philosophy etc., but an excellent teacher",
      "Killer exams. Spend more time on this course than OS! Helpful outside class",
      "good prof, but exams are like assignments! TUFF!",
      "Very intelligent prof, too bad course is dull",
      "all I can say, is that this guy made the course fun!",
      "Genuinely intelligent prof. (No, really.) Friendly and helpful, too.",
      "i think he should prep more. he was trying to figure stuff out as he went along",
      "loose the white shoes&black jeans Mr RUNDMC goodprof+badcourse=forgetful course",

      "Jeffrey Shallit was an amazing professor. Very well written exams, and really did make algorithms an incredibly fun class.",
      "His lectures were interesting and engaging. Midterm and final were easy and you are allowed to bring cheat sheet with whatever you want on it. You can always drop by his office every day and each assignment has 5 bonus marks. He will not directly give you the solution but will encourage you to find it by yourself. (some people may dislike this)",
      "Bunch of office hours and a lot of bonus marks in the assignment. His exam is easier compared with other professor and you are allowed to bring the cheat sheet. Algorithm is not a course for remembering.",
      "His exam is easier compared with other professors and in the assignment, there are a lot of bonus questions.",
      "Awesome dude, cares for his students a lot and knows how to teach. Also humorous guy, one of the best profs.",
      "His lectures were interesting and engaging. Midterm and final were easy, but he was very tough with the marking, for both tests and assignments. Assignments were challenging. Overall, great prof for CS 341.",
      "Pretty good prof. Knows cs and mathematics very well and explains concepts in a very clear way. A little bit intimidating to ask questions. Try to ask clever questions. Exams were fair, assignments were kind of tricky. Very passionate and smart person in his area.",
      "The assignments & midterms are ok. The final is brutal. Crystal clear but unwilling to answer questions related to exams. Has a strong passion about teaching & mathematics.",
      "I think Jeffrey is a pretty cool guy. Eh kills cs problems and doesn't afraid of anything",
      "Shallit is clearly passionate about the material, and does a very good job of organizing a good lecture. Encourages active participation from class (sometimes \"voluntolds\" people) and answers questions patiently. About the course : he knows the material really well, but a tough grader. Get ready to hit the books :)",
      "Very hard and challenging course. But very interesting too. And professor Shallit is cool and extremely fair.",
      "They say CS350 is hard. IMO, this class is harder. Prof Shallit knows his stuff, makes the course interesting, explains things really clear, but at the same time, those without the mathematical background will suffer.",
      "Interesting, passionate, clear, hard assignments and exams. Told us to do what we can of them (seems to me, as if expecting us to fail) and they were all (all parts too) mandatory.",
      "Make no mistake about it, this is a difficult course and it's being taught by someone who has extensive (and I mean EXTENSIVE) background knowledge in the area. The assignments are quite challenging, but not unreasonable. Midterm & final are pretty brutal. If you go to lectures and take notes, you should be pretty good, but effort is required.",
      "Funny, Interesting. Good prof. However, he is FREAKING HARD. Assignments are WAY harder than other profs. INSANE amount of mathematics background required to deal with his questions. Really smart guy, but has tendency to cater the lecture to the smartest people in class. Crazy hard midterms, Crazy hard assignments. Take him if you want to die.",
      "excellent prof",
      "Awsome prof! He remembers everyones names. The lectures were really interesting. Assignments and exams were challenging but were fair.",
      "A great time is had every lecture, thanks in no small part to the depth of knowledge Shallit has on the content of the course, and the history behind the development of Computer Science.",
      "Very comical guy, he'd do some pretty elaborate things to be funny in class, which does make it more interesting. He goes through material fast and sometimes things he does are unclear. Teaches mainly by example.",
      "Very interesting (and often humourous) lectures and most assignments are challenging. FLAP textbook is written by Shallit himself and is an extremely valuable resource. Shallit is passionate about the material and is always willing to help students. I highly recommend his classes to anyone even moderately interested in the subject matter.",
      "Great prof. Can be very challenging though - advice to those taking this course unless you're a former IMO member, try not to take more than 2 other intesnse high level courses (eg 400 pmaths 400 CS killer courses etc.) If you battle through every problem in Sipser, you can easily get pretty close to 100%.",
      "He's good for smart people, but may be a bit fast for those not too smart. Either way he's very good, and is probably one of the least boring profs in CS department.",
      "Great course, the professor is very passionate about the material. Some of the assignment problems are quite hard. He brought us cake for his birthday :).",
      "Very clear instruction. A lot of interesting stuff in lecturing. Moderate assignments.",
      "He presented the material, which can be a bit boring because of its abstractness, in an interesting way. It's quite obvious he is very interested in the field.",
      "The course is pretty interesting. It contains a lot of concepts that require time and practice to understand fully. So whereas the notes are excellent, there is a distinct benefit to going to the class, as the professor explains the concepts very clearly.",
      "Hardest class I've taken here (I haven't taken any of the killer courses, though). Prof was mildly entertaining. Never dreaded going to class. Teaches directly from his book, though, which is my only complaint.",
      "Very smart man...",
      "Two thumbs up!",
      "Really good for good students, but if you are as stupid as I am youll probably have a hard time working the assignments. They are tough, but he is willing to help you, always, no matter how stupid you are. :). Great guy, nice personality. A++++ will buy again....",
      "Holding virtual office hours via Instant Messenger at the night before the assignment is due, what more can I say about how great this prof is&#63;",
      "Jeffrey Shallit is an awesome professor! I'm always very impressed with his ability to capture and then maintain my interest. He also seems to care about genuinely care about helping his students to get involved and learn the material.",
      "If you enjoy CS theory, then you will enjoy Professor Shallit. He delivers his helpful lectures with pride and enthusiasm. He is also encouraging and listens to what students have to say. However, his assignments may be more work than you're willing or able to undertake.",
      "Easy one of the best teachers in the school, period.",
      "Great professor, can explain complex topics in a very accessible way. Seems to love what he teaches and it shows by the presentation of his lecture, which are clear and concise. Takes the time to know his students by name, which really makes a difference.",
      "Learns students' names. Knows every last detail about the material. Good explanations and he's really interested in the course material. Excellent prof.",
      "One of the best professors I had in 5 years at UW. You don't want anyone else teaching you formal languages. He gave out cool prizes for people who asked good questions or answered hard problems.",
      "best prof I have had since I come to unversity",
      "Shallit did an outstanding job with this course. He's taken material that can be quite difficult (and boring) and made it accessible and fun. Two thumbs up!",
      "This is an interesting course, but the problem sets and exam are difficult if you don't work hard. Prof Shallit is very helpful when you go in for extra help.",

      "GOOD",

      "Lori Case is extremely knowledgeable about computer science. Her lectures are clear and comprehensive. She explains and emphasizes important concepts several times in class though this may sound repetitive. Overall, she is an excellent professor. I would definitely recommend her for CS 115 and CS 116.",
      "Easy course, my roommate and I both fell asleep in every lecture after the first month or so and still both had As. Not easy for everyone though. She re-explains concepts several times making it boring if you understood the first time. Good if you didn't understand though I guess",
      "Amazing prof! She's amazingly clear and makes computer science really easy for first-time learners. Definitely recommend!",
      "gives many examples, always willing to answer questions, always understanding of your circumstances. Assignments take forever to do, do yourself a favour and DON'T LEAVE THEM TILL THE NIGHT BEFORE, or you will suffer. One average, they take about 5-9 hours to do, and you have one every week.",

      "Really a good prof. I thought she was horrible in cs125, but that's just the boring course content, not her fault. You really can't teach programming on a chalk board. If you get her for 134 though, she's really good. Her explanations are extremely clear.",

      "Slow and boring at times, while rushed and haphazard at others. Nonetheless, she is still very clear and gives loads of examples to work with.

I knew nothing about programming whatsoever before taking this class and I'm doing really well right now.

She will repeatedly go over concepts again and again, until they become engraved into your mind...THAT IS A GOOD THING (for people like me)",

      "Overall a decent prof that teaches the material well. Even though you learn through the assignments, they are vague, unnecessarily tedious, and require you to follow a purely subjective coding style. Most programs are required to print output in a complex way when there are many simpler alternatives, and I resent wasting time on these aspects.",
      "He is simply the god of concurrency.",
      "Great prof. The course is hard but fun. I leaned a lot.",
      "One of the greatest professors at the University. Simply amazing. No more needs to be said.",
      "Assignments are tedious for this class so better to start earlier. Tests are not difficult if you memorize your assignment code and course note, would not require too much thinking. Peter is good prof, though sometimes he might explain things in not natural way. Prepare to learn such terms as \"Shmilbling\", \"Maluba\", \"Automagic\" and \"Daaaa\".",
      "He's definitely a great lecturer, but personally he kind of butchered CS246 for me (and for many others). Not a lot of object-oriented programming was taught, which I thought was the point of the class. The assignments were pretty tedious and boring. I don't think I learned too much, honestly. Wish I had Nomair. Other than that, Peter was solid.",
      "One of the best professors I ever had. An amazing lecturer. Very nice and inspirational.",
      "Hands down, one of the best CS profs; no more needs to be said.",
      "The best concurrency prof out there. Extremely enthusiastic, funny and crazy. You will love his lectures. His lecture is addicting and fluent to listen to. Concurrency is hard and he makes it easy to understand. Assignments are long and hard but very helpful. Gives exam solution so you can expect exam with same format. Can be impatient on Piazza.",
      "THE BEST PROF. His lecture are interesting and funny. Assignment takes time but not too challenging, as long as you spend long enough staring at it.",
      "My favourite prof. Really good at teaching this course. Although materials are hard, he is really good at explaining them. Exams are easy IF you know everything on the course notes. Really nothing out of surprise. Assignments are a bit challenging and takes time though.",
      "Best prof I've ever had during my 4 years in Waterloo.",
      "Great prof - an expert in the subject of concurrency, he knows his stuff. Extremely empathetic with students, and works with you if you're having issuesconcerns with any of the material. He's more interested in you learning than having you do a bunch of assignments for the sake of credit. Take this if you get a chance!",
      "Incredible professor! Very eager to help students debug, even though it is a third year course. Very knowledgeable about many CS related topics. Very interesting prof and perhaps the best on Waterloo campus.",
      "I had his CS246 lecture. He's one of the best prof I've ever met at UW. I wanted to take his CS343 at Fall term 2012 but he's temporary not in school. I will wait him till he's back.",
      "One of the best UW CS professors. Perhaps the best.",
      "Works very hard to make lectures entertaining/educational and actively helps students with their programming problems. An impressive professor. Assignments can be a little ambiguous. It might be intentional.",
      "Hilarious prof! I go to his lecture to get entertained, and in the process learn some C++/OOP. Lecture materials are both relevant and insightful. Assignments and tests are not easy, but doable. No need to go to tutorials, just pay attention in class. Overall, does a good job teaching what you will need in the workplace.",
      "Amazing prof. Funny, very interesting, knows his stuff. He makes the course hard but straightforward - you will learn a LOT. The final exam is hard, study his notes well! 5/5",
      "Moves quickly through lectures. Some independent learning. Great prof. Material was excellent and practical. Assignments are lengthy, but prove to be extremely helpful and teach you real world applications of CS such as the fact that some specifications are not 100% complete of programs and that some independent learning is needed in addition.",
      "Really smart guy, and a really good course. Tells interesting stories about programming languages. Many questions are straight from the course notes.",
      "He is the best prof in UW CS department. Although cs343 is usually a tough course, he really makes it easy. crystal lectures, helpful assignments and the best thing is he gave sample exam which is a great source to study from. A must take!!!!",
      "Amazing Prof! Difficult assignments and tests but the amount of stuff you'll learn about your coding styles and other things about the world of C++ is amazing. If you have the chance, take a course with him.",
      "The best CS prof in Waterloo. Love his lectures and his assignments. Helped me improve my coding skills as well as concurrency...Must take.",
      "Awesome prof! As everyone said, this guy makes hard concepts easy by using effective analogies. His classes are always a pleasure to go to. I've learned a TREMENDOUS amount in this course, both about concurrency and being a better coder. This is what a university course should be like. If you're going to take CS343, take it with Buhr!",
      "One of the best profs at Waterloo. Makes everything easy to understand using everyday analogies.",
      "He is someone who understands what teaching is all about and you can tell he truly enjoys it. An amazing presenter that provides you with tons of useful information and utilizes analogies very very effectively. I would have NEVER understood the reader/writer solution with split-binary semaphores without him explaining it. Go to all his lectures!",
      "He's been the best CS prof I've ever had. The content is not the easiest, but his slides and presentations are clear. He's clear about his biases, and tries very hard to justify them. Lectures are entertaining, informative and hilarious. He's not just interested in teaching you concurrency, he also is trying to make you a better coder period.",
      "No Comments",
      "Amazing prof who's always enthusiastic about the subject. He cares about the students and can answer questions with ease. He uses helpful analogies to get concepts across. Course notes were very thorough and accompanied his lectures well. Exams are not too hard if you study and listen in class. Very very good teacher.",
      "Excellent prof! Memorable/funny analogies for concepts taught. He loves teaching. He loves concurrency. Very nice guy as well.",
      "AMAZING prof. has a funny analogy for everything. who knew you can teach concurrency with a bathroom as an example! his classes are never boring and he really has the passion for teaching. highly recommended!",
      "This dude is fun, and relays material well and with cute examples. An example of an extraordinary professor.",
      "Amazing Prof. You should not take the course with anyone BUT him. He is extremely motivational and dedicated to teaching. There is nobody who knows more about the subject than him. Excellent at promoting questions in class and makes himself highly available outside of class.",
      "A great, friendly lecturer. He makes lots of fun (and geeky) jokes during the lecture. His lectures are never boring. Explains materials well.",
      "A bit dry at times, but otherwise very clear and helpful. If Caroline Kierstead is the course coordinator, ignore her. Always talk to Buhr instead, you will get a much better and clearer response.",
      "Excellent explanations. Too slow at times if the stuff makes sense to you, but very good overall. Seems very friendly. Assignments/tests seemed very straightforward; material was tested/reinforced well -- most well-organized course I've ever taken. If you have a choice, take this course for sure.",
      "This was a really really hard class. Well, at least he made it into one. He was a great prof, but concurrency is just a crazy class. No way around that.",
      "Best ComSci professor imo. Very entertaining and very easy to understand what he says, the clock always tick too fast in his lecture. Pretty much the only lecture I actually enjoy going.",
      "Best prof I ever had!",
      "Best professor I've had at Waterloo. Expert at concurrency and extremely funny and entertaining.",
      "This guy knows his concurrency man... don't even think about challenging him... go to his lectures.. awesome explanations... i wish i went more often.. but class was too early :(",
      "Great Professor! Know his stuffs and know how to teach :) Beautiful Explanation on everything.",
      "Solid.",
      "Clear and incredibly interesting lecturing on some extremely difficult topics. However, he did promise that we would grow our first gray hairs by the end of the course, and I know I did.",
      "Definitely the best CS prof, knows how to speak English and knows how to teach. What more could you ask for&#63;",
      "Awesome prof! If you take 342, go ONLY to his class",
      "Advice: Don't miss a single lecture of his. He explains everything beautifully. And if you don't understand something still...just download and read his text. Exact same examples from the course notes, but more verbose.",
      "No Comments",
      "If you take CS342, take his lecture!!",
      "uC++ is very good work. .. hzp.",
      "Def knows his stuff, goes through examples well, does not just read off the notes like Carolin. My only complaint was for him to tone down the silly responses that he would occasionally give to a valid question every once in a while.",

      "Good explanations and clearly enjoys teaching the course. Notes are handwritten on the board and his lectures are well organized.",
      "Loved the lectures, very organized and promoted students to be involved with the content. However, there was alot of material and sometimes we would only glaze through concepts that would show up in an assignment or exam in a significant way.",
      "This man can lecture. Always ready to answer any question, always correct lectures, always leaves time at the end to explore interesting cool things. Friendly, not boring, good opinions on what makes for good pedagogy. Best prof/lecturer I've had at UW. One of the few highlights of the faculty of UW.",
      "CS246E was a ride, but a fun ride. We learned a lot but there is a LOT of work. Overall Prof. Lushman's teaching style (which is very structured) worked well for this course (I don't think it would necessarily be the best for other courses though).",
      "Overall the course was well structured. However, it has too much materials, and they were very difficult.",
      "This was the first offering of CS246E offered, and Brad didn't hold back. His notes were very well organized from the very beginning, and you can tell he had taken a lot of time to structure this course out well. He wasn't easy, and introduced a lot of content. Also beware of the final project, as it sneaks up on you quickly. Overall, a solid prof.",
      "Very interesting course, and Brad does a fantastic job at organizing his lectures and his lecture notes. The course notes that he wrote are also great. Exams are tough - very comprehensive, and use those annoying exam booklets. I would highly recommend this course, despite it being difficult. It really opens your eyes to new ways of thinking.",
      "Absolutely crystal clear. His lectures were great to attend. All my friends either really love him or think he's mediocre, though, so your mileage may vary. For this course specifically: assignments were challenging but enjoyable; examinations are not unfair, but very, very comprehensive (which I think is perfectly fair). Know your stuff.",
      "Attend classes and do assignments and you will rock",
      "a very good prof teaching useful materials. Just follow up with the lecture and review the notes before exams, you will get a good mark, and learn well.",
      "Extremely interesting and rewarding course. Professor had enthusiasm and encouraged students to step out of their comfort zones. Fair assignments and exams.",
      "He could be more engaging. It's hard to pay attention for the full 1.5 hours, but his course notes are great to the point that you don't really need to go to class.",
      "Really smart guy, teaching style shows it. Asks for class participation a lot. Class can sometimes get boring, mostly because of the content. Wasn't super helpful during office hours. Lectures are super helpful for assignments.",
      "Brad is an amazing professor, the lectures are well structured and extremely relevant. Definitely one of my favourite CS courses!",
      "Makes what could be very boring content into extremely interesting lectures. He also sets you up to suceed in e assignments.",
      "Really good notes and good explanations. Not the easiest prof but I do think taking his CS 246 really builds up a good base. I am currently in 4th year and still do appreciate his 246 and 240 classes.",
      "One of the best proffesors, very helpful during office hours, nicely and neatly designed lectures. Could be better if he can hold more office hours.",
      "good lectures, wont hold your hand though",
      "nice prof, lectures were clear and anything that wasn't he was willing to explain. tough assignments but you should probably get used to that",
      "Has the most useful and thorough lectures, but his courses are hard.",
      "Most of his lectures were very clear. During office hours he preferred not to answer questions directly, instead he gave students a hint which always worked for me. Exams were a bit hard. Overall, I learned a lot and now I continue to develop my skills in OOP on my own : )",
      "The comments below have little merit. Brad set a fair midterm and a fair final and his lectures were crystal clear. While he may have reused assignments, other courses such as CS 136 tend to do the same thing. He answered all important questions on Piazza, and had genuine reasons for not giving out midterm solns. I'm satisfied.",
      "Great prof, take notes. Very clear, great lectures. Pay attention and you should do well. Attend this guy's lectures he's really good.",
      "Great prof. Super clear. Great notes. The notes are all you need. Some assignments are long but the class is not too hard. Make sure you attend class because the notes are all you have.",
      "THIS PROF IS THE BEST PROF I'VE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE CS UNDERGRAD. No seriously, this guy is amazing, he's made a serious impact on my level of interest and understanding of Computer Science. And he's so approachable.",
      "He is such an amazing prof for CS. He is well prepared for all of his lectures and explains extremely clear and concise. CS 246 is a very important course and the most useful course. I am glad that I had Brad for this course. I learned a lot. The only drawback is he wasted time writing code on the board that can be shown to us on the screen.",
      "One of the best CS profs. He has his own notes and is very familiar with the course. Brad transitions between topics very well-- making the course very coherent and clear for students. His 8:30 class still had great attendance near the end of the course.",
      "Great prof. Always has clear explanations and well presented material.",
      "Great prof! I took cs135 with him in winter. As it was my first CS course (being a cs major), I was amazed by his clarity and teaching skills. He is definitely one of the best lecturers out there!",
      "Really nice instructor. You will definitely learn lots of stuff! Take his course!",
      "Had 246 as well as 240 with Lushbear. He is brilliant and explains things clearly. Great style of teaching, going to class is mandatory. Assignments are challenging nightmares but he is always available for help. Tests are pretty fair.",
      "Very interesting course, very well taught. Probably the best prof I've ever had in terms of teaching style, clarity, and answering student questions. The assignments were very useful for understanding course mat. although there were always a few ambiguities (always check piazza). Midterm was a little iffy but Final was very fair.",
      "Great prof, excellently prepared lectures, and a passionate guy. The way he teaches is good regardless of prior knowledge level. He cares for his students! Wish more profs were like Brad!",
      "One of the best Prof's I had. He writes his own notes and they are really clear and easy to understand. A definite choice for future cs courses!",
      "Amazing prof. I switched out of my original section to Brad's 8:30 class because he gives really helpful notes on the board, encourages discussion, and really knows how to teach! Also makes quick responses via email and piazza",
      "Lectures and notes were very clear and coherent. Very helpful outside of class. Would love to take future CS classes taught by him.",
      "Great professor, his explanation and organization of topics makes the course easy to understand. I hope I have him again.",
      "This guy is the best professor I've had so far in Waterloo. Great lecturer and great notes. He is also very helpful outside of class and nice. Attend his lectures if you have the chance.",
      "Notes are extremely organized and well presented. Content is presented and taught very well. Excellent prof.",
      "A great lecturer, walks you through and knows how a CSer thinks. Very helpful, and very interested in students success. He is also really cool in a CS professor way! He ROCKS! Best professor I've had so far.",
      "Nice explanations and really helpful outside of class. Cool prof.",
      "Very good prof. Helpful during and after class, will try to make time to help you if you have an issue outside of appointment time. Provides notes online and hints during class.",
      "Took this course in Dalhousie. Probably the most knowledgeable, enthusiastic (in introverted way), and helpful prof I've ever had. He really knows his stuff and if you struggle he'll always make sure you understand. Found the course hard, but I highly recommend it. You'll absolutely love it. He is the prof you'll never forget. A+",
      "Awesome prof! Really knows how to explain stuff. Chalkboard notes are extremely helpful! I had a great time in this course!",
      "Good prof, easily understood.",
      "Awesome prof. This class was awesome and he nailed everything down so perfectly. It was kind of hard; but worth it.",
      "I don't agree with any of these posters... I aced his class. His only main problem while teaching is lack of humour - Logic is too dry without laughter. Yes, assignments were hard but always doable and he ALWAYS replied to questions. Midterm was 100% straight forward and the final was tough but huge bell curve (80 marked out of 65) helped.",
      "Incredibly difficult prof. His difficulty lies in his intelligence. That is, he is a rather brilliant man, however, the assignments and tests were clearly made for other rather brilliant people, as they are long and extremely hard. Our rapid decrease in class size demonstrates this. If you want to learn a lot but not pass, take a lushman class.",
      "assignments are EXTREMELY time-consuming. midterm was somewhat unfair. my expectations for the course were not met.. i should've known that at UW it would be totally theory focussed. i would not recommend this this course.",
      "Assignments were extremely time consuming, perhaps to the point of being excessive. He is very knowledgeable however, and is willing to help and is enthusiastic about the Programming Languages Field. I'd recommend the course with Brad IF AND ONLY IF you are interested in the topic, and NOT if you are looking for a lighter 4th CS course.",
      "The assignments were brutal, but now that they're over, I'm glad they were... learned a lot. He's a great prof, very knowledgeable and is happy to answer questions.",
      "he is always patient and ready to help outside class! you can always get help from him even late at midnight or very early in the morning. I usually got his response by email within 15 mins even I sent my questions to him at 2:30 am!!! The course is quite heavy and tough, so a guy like him is always needed and appreciated!!",
      "Excellent prof... but very hard assignments and midterm.",
      "This was the single most difficult and rewarding class I took at my time at UW. Well worth the effort thanks to the prof.",
      "Great guy. Very helpful. Always there if you need help. Assignments are WAY too long though. I spent 90% of my time on his course when I had 4 other courses to work on. Overall great job though.",
      "Great!"

I would say his pace is reasonable if you have programmed before. However, I know others who hadn't said he was a bit too fast. Always willing to answer questions - even during lectures!",
      "I loved attending his lectures, even in the mornings. I attended different profs sometimes with my friends to compare and he was honestly by far my favourite compared to the other prof's teaching styles. Often writes on the board for clarification, which I find is very helpful. Seems passionate about what he does and makes the lectures interesting.",

      "I really loved Mark as a professor. He was always funny and entertaining (which is tough for an 8:30 class three days a week). I did really, really well in the class and he surprised me with a reference letter I didn't even ask for! Great guy, great class, I just wish more people took it seriously.",

Quite a hard final (almost failed the course).",

Very helpful in office hours, and made his assignments relatively fair. The TA's were very bad, so as compensation he bought the class pizza at the end of the year!",
      "Great guy, I had him for a couple other classes. Theoretical CS is not my cup of tea, but Mark's explanations/analogies were good enough for me to understand (Although, it would be nice to see more use of slides since his writing is a bit messy). Also very helpful in OH/discussion board.",
      "He's really funny and keeps the class interesting. Kind of mumbles though and has a boring voice.",
      "The course content is not personalized to the teacher, and rather is taught straight from the book. Petrick should do a more personalized teaching strategy, even though he is already a good teacher. More higher level concepts should of been taught.",
      "hilarious",
      "Course is kinda hard. His explanations are decent but not super clear. If you don't understand him too well try the tutors and see if they're better. A tricky course.",
      "Excellent, engaging prof. Knows his material, is excited by it, and tries to get the students excited about it too. Very approachable, and willing to explain himself to students who ask. Also willing to own up to his mistakes and not punish students for them. If anyone asked me, I'd vote the school hire him full-time",
      "fair exam, nice guy. One of the more straightforward and easy to talk to profs at UW.",
      "He has a high level of interest towards the course, and cared a lot about his students. Great prof.",
      "He keeps lectures fun by throwing in jokes when the class starts to lose focus. He is really helpful, and easy to talk to. Overall awesome prof!",
      "Mark is an awesome prof. His lectures are clear and he is interesting to listen to. He also is very willing to help students who have difficulties with any part of the course",
      "Mark puts a lot of effort into his lectures and really cares about the students. One of the nicest most approachable profs, and is also extremely helpful.",
      "C is mind numbing [one word: pointers] and the assignments are no small task; however, this guy does a solid job of teaching you what you need, and highlighting all the common errors you WILL make, and how to do the troubleshooting .. very useful prof, would recommend",
      "I found the lectures for both CS135 and 136 (the only CS courses I took) to be boring, mainly because of how they just read off the slides. Mark Petrick seems like a nice professor and he did try to expand on some of the slides. I stopped going to lectures near the end; but he's not a bad prof at all.",
      "My favourite class of 1B. CS 136 covers a lot of useful and interesting material on C. He is pretty funny in class. He teaches very well. I never get bored for listening to him. He writes on the board to explain memory diagrams. However the diagrams are a bit messy but I can understand them. He also answers Piazza questions. Amazing prof.",
      "Pretty funny, says interesting things, easy to approach.",
      "Amazing Prof. Extremelly intelligent, but does such a good job bringing the course down to an easily understandable level, that he doesn't seem too distant. Very approachable after lecture for help as well as for casual conversation. Has a good sense of humour.",
      "Gives clear, straightforward explanations that lead students to an answer. Textbook listed as \"required\" for course but is actually not needed. Assignments and exams challenging but fair. Handwriting occasionally messy enough that it can be hard to distinguish Sigma (summation), Epsilon (empty string) and (element-of).",
      "Great professor. Extremely helpful!",
      "Cool prof, always wears shorts, even when its cold out, and he is kind of boring but he covers necessary materials. His midterms are fair and he shouldnt let some students walk all over him, hes a nice guy it seems.",
      "Pretty good prof. Explains things quite well, puts geek references into lectures, etc. He's really down-to-earth when you talk to him 1-on-1. My only complaint is he should talk louder. The course itself was extremely disorganized, but it would've been that way regardless of who the prof was.",
      "Laid back and pretty thorough with his explanations. Addresses questions in lecture clearly. Great prof. overall.",
      "just read slides in lec but did lots of explaination after classs. Really helpful guy but not much good at teaching, which means u should talk much to him after lecture",
      "lots examples/notes but need go to class for them. prof is very knowledgable to talk to in office hours.",
      "Still a kool shirt. Lamers spam rates too. Lots extra examples and good explain for 115.",
      "Clear explanations in class with good examples of different structures to think about. Maybe more examples on how to use them. Gives straight forward answers. Great Dalek shirt!!",
      "Clear explanations in class with good examples of different structures to think about. Maybe more examples on how to use them. Gives straight forward answers. Great dalek shirt!",
      "Best Prof! always willing to help after class even when not office hour.",
      "This is a very good prof. Very interesting.",
      "well organized but hard to keep up. course could use a textbook or course notes. Prof is nice, talked to him lots.",
      "well organised. professor cracks some jokes, lots of prof quotes.",
      "Spent the most time on this course and got the lowest mark of all my courses. Learned the most and wrote the most code of any other course. Great course. Notes are well organized if you get them all. Fast paced. Miss classes and your lost. Not textbook or Course Notes. Exams based on notes. Sounds like others missed a lot a classes :)",
      "Although his lectures (and the subject matter) were really boring, he is a really nice prof and tries to joke sometimes. He is really friendly and is super nice and helpful if you go to his office hours. I am not good at CS and struggled with the course, but he helped me out a lot for the final."

      "He is really great! He explains things vividly and hilariously. Would never forget the explanation he made on classes. Go to his lectures if you can!",
      "Dave's awesome, his diagrams makes everything look simple and his jokes make the class interesting unlike other profs that I went to. Those who don't pay attention to class tend to not like him. I would recommend going to his lectures for cs 136.",

      "God of CS135. Difficult course, but he tries to make it easy",
      "There is no doubt that he is the best for CS135. Take his section if possible. I am very disappointed that he is not gonna teach CS136.",
      "I enjoyed Dave Tompkins' class because of how light and interesting he made the course. Most of the material was covered in a clear, concise and fun way that made the learning process very engaging.",

      "Great representational skills! Uses funny and accurate real-life comparisons to explain concepts. Constantly keeps you up-to-date where he is going with the curriculum.",
      "Gave me $10 for getting a demonstration answer on the board correct and overall awesome guy",

      "Nice professor, interesting teaching style with clear explanation",

      "Great prof. Tough course. His lectures were very interesting and entertaining. He is definitely one of the best ones.",
      "Amazing professor. Gives simple examples to explain the material. Uses quite a few analogies to make concepts easy to understand. He's definitely one of the best profs at the school. He's also extremely funny. Would take another course from him.",
      "Dave Tompkins is an awesome professor! He is always in a good mood and tries to keep the class invlove. Even thought the project involves some headache and a lot of time the classes are fun!",
      "Great prof))explains everything with interesting examples:)",
      "Created an account to show support since this is the first time he's teaching cs350. CS350 is such a core course. He taught it clearly and in a fun atmosphere. He doesn't research OS but can give concrete, real world examples and illustrations. Recommend for cs350.",
      "Ideal prof for a subject that might be intimidating to newcomers (like me). Always has an interesting analogy to explain the key concepts so you don't forget it. He is very enthusiastic and energetic. Never thought I would enjoy CS lectures but I was wrong",
      "Amazing prof. He made the class very interesting. He is very good at explaining everything. I had done programming before, but we were learning a new language, but he made it easy to do. I definitely want another course with him if possible.",
      "Very entertaining prof. Uses all sorts of funny examples, stories and even did some role-playing to explain the material. Would have gone for him again if he taught CS116. Was also helpful during office hours and is friendly and knowledgeable.",
      "Good prof but went through the material quite fast. Could have provided more examples other than what was in the courseware. He made up for it in the end by having two review sessions with great examples and then holding a nice review (office hours) the day before the exam. Would definitely take one of his classes again.",
      "An great professor who makes his class interesting. He does great analogies and is incredibly funny.",
      "Makes the course interesting. Sometimes goes too fast though, but is very friendly during his office hours.",
      "Hilarious dude, and he's really smart. Oh and he's a part time DJ. And did I mention he's funny as hell&#63;",
      "He is funny in the class~~ And if you have anything dont understand, you can book an appointment with him and he is so helpful with solving the questions!! PLUS! He is the cousin of Mike Tompkins!!! What else do you want!!!"

      "He's easy to approach outside of class and will always answer your questions as specifically as he can. Incredible guy both in the classroom and outside.",
      "If Igor is your prof, you're very lucky! He's honestly so caring and really wants you everyone to do well. The man even brings in coffee and timbits as a special treat for his students. He's so nice!",
      "Igor is extremely caring and very dedicated towards teaching. He wants every student to do well and understand his material, often making himself available for countless hours outside of lectures. His courses are well structured and organized. He provides lots of ungraded practice to ensure his students can always perform well on assessments.",
      "Best prof you could ever ask for. He is very engaging and genuinely cares about his students. The final was really hard but was graded pretty fairly.",
      "Igor is the best professor ever. He cares so much about his students and really tries hard to be engaging and fun. He puts cool animal pictures in his powerpoints, especially wolves. 11/10 would recommend",
      "Best prof I ever had in Waterloo CS",
      "Dr. Ivkovic is the NICEST professor you will ever have. He knows the material really well, tries to engage students in every class, and is a great lecturer. The class itself is easy, and classes are not mandatory for good grades, but many people went for his lectures! Responds to emails fast, and really cares about his students.",
      "terrific lecturer, just a rather boring course sometimes, so easy to lose focus in class. always available for contact though, extremely helpful outside of class. easy course if you use the recommended textbook",
      "Great professor with passionate attitude to CS.",
      "I didn't find CP102 that easy and I've spent a lot of time studying. The instructor tried really hard to make it interesting to us. I really enjoyed the videos on new technology that he showed in class. I recommend that you attend lectures or you will be lost otherwise.",
      "Bell curved every midterm and exam!!! Don't have to go to his lectures as he just reads off the slides. Easy class! Make sure to take it with him.",
      "great person",
      "great prof, exams are quite straight forward compare to previous terms, he also gave hints before midterm/finals.",
      "Very good professor, cares for his students. I took CS350 with him, he doesn't only teach the materials those don't change in 10 years, but he apply those theories into modern technology in his slides as well. If you are here to obtain whatever grade, I guess any \"easy\" prof works, but if you really want to learn stuff, I'd definitely recommend him",
      "The course material itself is very tough (I am sure you have heard). I have had Igor for 3 courses now (246,245 and now 350), and the one thing that everyone notices is that he truly cares about his students. He is improving everyday and will continue to do so. I recommend taking any course he teaches as you will have a great time. Thank you Igor!",
      "Terrific professor. If you get him as a teacher, make sure to go to class as he gives lots of hints about what's going to be on the midterm/final. Explains things in detail (perhaps a little too much) but I think its good since he actually cares that we learn something. Very helpful and very friendly.",
      "He is so helpful; he did a good job in teaching us.His respect to his student was really exceptional. The course content was useful and the expiation was to the last drop. Anyway, you may think that his exams will be easy but IT IS NOT. You have to study really really well, concentrate on slides, and make sure you understand EVERY single slide.",
      "Material is presented dry-ish. He tries to be a good teacher though. Half of lectures were kind of useless, but course projects are interesting.",
      "nice guy,helps when needed and gives you a pretty good idea what the finals would be from. great prof.",
      "Prof. Ivkovic is very knowledgeable and professional. One of the best courses that I've ever taken. A+",
      "Tough course, no doubt. Without this guy, I wouldn't have made it this far. If you are in CS, take it when he is teaching it.",
      "Awesome proff. Attend the sections he teaches. He explains stuff really well.",
      "Amazing prof! Highly recommend him for this class. Super detailed and clear.",
      "Excellent prof. I attend his class instead of other profes since he explains stuff more. Go to his sections if you can.",
      "Bird course. Easiest I've taken so far. He makes everything clear and his slides are enough for all your studying. He always welcomes questions and answers well. If you talk to him after class he always takes time to explain everything well. Great prof. One of the best at Waterloo.",
      "One of those profs who really cares about the students!",
      "Awesome guy! Takes the time to explain stuff many ways so that all can understand. Gives real world actual exmples so that 251 theory actually made sennse. Assignments were long though for the points assigned. Be ready for a bunch of work if you will take the course!",
      "Awesome prof. The course kinda sorta breaks you but the proff really rocks. Great slides, saved my butt.",
      "I didn't find the course easy (superscalar MIPS pipeline???). But the prof really tried to help us out. And if you actually asked for help, he stayed for hours during his off. hours answering our questions.",
      "Igor is the man, for real! Very poor TAs in this course since some of the marking was sad. If you don't attend his lectures then you will for sure find the course confusing and whatever, but if you simply show up to most of his lectures you will ace the course. Hopefully he teaches us CS 350. =)",
      "I don't want to be harsh on the guy - hes a nice prof, but I must say that he may be inexperienced in teaching 251 and looking back, I honestly found his offering of this course to be a bit half-baked. There were some bad/ambiguous/poorly marked questions on tests/assigns and the recommended textbook/course notes were utterly unnecessary.",
      "Nice slides, generally seems like a nice guy, helped us out a lot with 245 last term. Unfortunately he wasn't as forthcoming with as many hints for the 251 final as he was for 245.",
      "Igor is one of the best CS profs at UW. I've had him for 3 courses now and he has never failed to be friendly, helpful, and an interesting lecturer. He always makes himself available to help students and answers questions clearly and concisely.",
      "Fantastic personality and a good overall lecturer. Course itself is quite dry - mostly facts + procedures in how bits of a computer works. To be honest I slept through most classes and just read slides, but I still managed to get 90+ on midterm/assignments, so I suppose that says something about the quality of Igor's slides and the course overall.",
      "You don't need to read the textbook just his slides are enough. Go to lectures and pay attention and he will do everything possible to make sure you do really well. A great teacher always really clear in his explanations. Always explains the assignments and what is required.",
      "He made this course impossible! On the first day, he said it was a complete bird course, but in reality, it's just a course about too many random facts. He made 245 easy, but 251 quite difficult.",
      "The best prof I have ever met. Igor is the KING! He is very dedicated and really wants students to succeed. It's my great honour to meet this guy and learn from him. Well-prepared lectures, office hours,more-than-helpful review sessions, many many posts on Piazza... definitely take his course if YOU CAN!!!",
      "He is honestly one of the most caring profs at UW! He's always got your back - so take advantage of this!",
      "A very nice professor. Highly recommended to take this course with him.",
      "This man is truly one of the best professors at UW. Funny, friendly, and extremely helpful. The fact that people were lining up to try and fit in his class for up to 45 minutes before it started speaks for itself. If you have the opportunity to take a course from him, I strongly recommend that you take the chance.",
      "Igor's the man!! Seriously, this guy is the only prof I've seen that genuinely wants to see students learn AND do well. H explains things really clearly. Great review sessions, too. Awesome slides. Very reasonable guy. The lineup for his class was ridiculous. I wish Igor taught ALL of my courses.",
      "Igor is a above all a good guy. He goes out of his way to make review sessions and spends time in class reviewing the difficult assignment questions. He is completely fair and there is no reason you should not get at least a B in his courses.",
      "Amazing professor. Goes ridiculously far out of his way to help people. Great at explaining things, perfect lectures. The man is a genius--one of the most prized professors by Waterloo University, I'm sure.",
      "Great Prof",
      "Probably the only professor that can make a hard course seem easy is Igor. He is very helpful and his classes are very interesting. I loved his teaching and hope to have him in future CS courses!!! :)",
      "I really appreciate the work he put into extra materials such as his slides. He was also great for answering people's questions, and the review session he did before the exam was helpful.",
      "He is a good person that helps his students with all he can. He spends extra time to help them understand the material and gives them extra materials if need to understand the course. He is an amazing prof!",
      "Igor did a fantastic job with this course. His review sessions were amazingly helpful, and he was very dedicated to answering everyone's questions on piazza. Great Prof (and I wasn't even in his section).",
      "Igor is a fantastic instructor. I have been fortunate enough to have him for both CS245 and CS246. He's incredibly kind, knowledgeable, and genuinely cares about the welfare of his students. Igor is the reason anyone earns their logic credit this fall; without his review sessions, lecture slides, and assignment hints we CS majors would be doomed.",
      "Igor is a wonderful prof. Very helpful and will go out of his way to help you succeed. Highly recommend taking his section of both CS245 and CS246. Slides can be dry, but it's dry material. He skips through the useless bits to get to more interesting parts. Huzzah for Igor!",
      "Very organized. Though slides can get quite dry at times, he recognizes this and skims through less important stuff and ends the class early. Overall, what a prof should be.",
      "Extremely kind and helpful. Had him for both CS245/CS246 and the lectures were excellent. Having zero experience in programming except the prerequisites, he made CS246 a very fun and entertaining course. A must have for any course!",
      "This guy is made from pure essence of Gucci.",
      "This course would have been awful if it weren't for Igor. He really puts his best effort into helping students and being available to those who are struggling.",
      "Excellent Professor. Made a horribly developed/confusing course much clearer and easier to understand. Although the course is still hard, he provides lots of supplemental material and is always there for help. He wants to see people succeed. Very kind and helpful.",
      "Very nice and effective at teaching. Covers all necessary content and doesn't waste time. He will help with assignment questions in class. He covers material at a great rate and will end class early when he feels all content has been covered, which it has.",
      "Fantastic professor! Friendly and professional, explains things really well, and often ends lectures early when he gets through all necessary content. Always makes more time to help students in need and really cares about helping everyone pass. Tests are fair and satisfying. Great guy!",
      "Pretty usful class; knows what hes talking about!",
      "He is enthusiastic about the subject.... great presentation skills... assignments were useful but I wish they were harder...",
      "Very caring about students. Make the assigments mandatory. Cookies. :)",
      "Introduced new material relevant to the field of software engineering. Good technique. Sometimes the prof goes too deep into explanations.",
      "Fair prof but you have to follow the textbook.",
      "Nice guy, really wants to help the students do well. BUT, his slides are unclear, ambiguous, and often wrong. He also explains things incorrectly and has to correct himself (or be corrected by a student) several times in a lecture. When the lecture's done, it's hard to remember which things were actually correct.",
      "Good Prof",
      "Very clear slides and very helpful professor. His lectures are fast at times but he stops for questions often.",
      "It was a good course and a good instructor. I actually learned stuff that I could use in my job after graduating. Tough final exam, but if you study you'll do well.",
      "Excellent prof. Switched to his section since I couldn't understand the other prof. He explained the material very well. Wish I had him for some of the other CS course.",
      "So he's a pretty reasonable professor in terms of examinations and quizzes, but the lectures overall tend to be a bit bland. He basically reads off of the pre-prepared slides, but does give his own little anecdotes where he sees fit. The group project was probably the only real 'useful' thing done in class. He's worked in industry, and it shows."

      "Mr Kaplan always keep things interesting even though the entirety of CS116 is just reading off slides",
      "Great lectures. He can always make me laugh and just amazing lectures. One of the best prof in UW",
      "Entertaining, really willing to engage if you're into CS--stayed after class several times to discuss and clarify random theory questions, etc. Enjoyed the class.",
      "The best prof I had seen in UW, excellent explanations and willing to help students",
      "Best prof I have ever had in UW. Very funny and very helpful at all the times.",
      "I have taken both cs 135 and cs 488 with this prof. Hands down the best cs professor in UW.",
      "If you have a chance to take a class with Craig, do it. It will change your religious beliefs, guaranteed.",
      "Great prof, made the class very entertaining and often expanded on material in the slides. Attendance was mandatory due to clicker questions, but don't worry: You will WANT to go to every class!",
      "Best professor I've ever had. Makes the course VERY interesting!",
      "So good he makes me cry!",
      "Nothing but respect for this man. He is truly passionate about Computer Science and you can tell in his lectures that he enjoys teaching it. Craig Kaplan all the way!",

      "Good prof. Explained things very well. Seems very passionate about CS. Good luck with your research, csk!",
      "Very good lecturer. His analogies are highly relevant and very helpful. He also knows his stuff: he'll often throw in some alterations to the code in the slides to make them better and explains them thoroughly. Also, VERY funny =)",
      "Awesome prof! He was a guest lecturer in my class but he was still very knowledgeable and interesting.",
      "Very enthusiastic and animated. You won't be falling asleep in his class.",
      "Amazing prof! Presents material in an interesting and entertaining way. Very approachable, and answers questions clearly.",

      "He is clear in explaining concepts and has great organizatio",
      "Awesome lecturer. Clarified concepts and kept things interesting.",
      "Great, clear",
      "Fantastic professor. He was a substitute for our CS 349 User Interfaces course as a replacement for Michael Terry. He was very coherent, clear, and concise when speaking.",
      "Awesome prof, really clear and amazing organization. Rockstar!",
      "This guy is very clear on the course content, very helpful",
      "A really great and smart prof. One of the very few people in the world that I'd define as really smart.Knows his stuff, does everything in order to teach you, is extremely funny,and his jokes are shrewd and 'designed' in a smart way lol.And he's one of the very(extremely!) few people that withstood my endless questions! Thus, my best 1st year prof!",
      "Fantastic professor. Anyone interested in Computer Science MUST take a course that he teaches. Knows how to combine humour and material without wasting class time. Impossible to be bored in his class or to want to miss his class. 100% satisfaction guaranteed!",
      "Awesome professor. Lectures are clear and fairly easy to understand. He is also always availale for help.",
      "Great Prof, I wish I would get him on upper year cs courses.",
      "Great Professor. He could teach computer science to anyone and anything!",
      "Awesome professor is awesome",
      "Very intelligent and passionate about his subject to boot. Clear, organized lectures and slides posted online.",
      "BEST PROF I'VE EVER HAD! Lectures were fascinating and insightful. I had little interest in CS before I took his class, but now I love it. Really inspiring.",
      "Amazing professor. Probably the best CS teacher I've ever had. Funny and explains new concepts in interesting ways that make you understand them in a somewhat different way if you already know them. Prepares you for assignments and midterms/final well.",
      "I despised CS, not because of him, but because the course was really tough for me. He helped me in office appointments for hours in the weeks leading up to the final exam. Thanks to him, I aced it!",
      "awesome prof! His class is so fun and he explains things so clear ! love him! love how he uses &quot;pancake&quot; as his example everyt ime!",
      "An AMAZING prof. If you can, take a course with him. He's really hilarious but still manages to be really helpful and crystal clear while explaining things. He goes out of his way to explain things better than the pre-made course slides. It was a first year course but you could tell he's very intelligent and really knows his stuff.",
      "Kaplan has got to be one of THE most amazing profs in all of UW. His explanations are crystal clear and his analogies actually help. His energy and enthusiasm really grabs your attention, even on days where you're having trouble staying awake. Definitely recommend taking his class.",
      "interesting",
      "Craig is one of the best CS professors I've had in my 4 years at UW. The only prof that comes close is Ed Lank, but then Kaplan is funnier (and maybe smarter too..). CS488 is one of the 'tough 3' CS courses at UW, but so long as you take it with Kaplan, its a lot of fun and you'll learn quite a bit.",
      "Best Prof I ever had. Convinced me to go to Grad School.",
      "Very funny prof!",
      "great prof, explained the materials well.",
      "Best CS prof period!",
      "What do I get to say here with all the comments been said in previous posts&#63; Oh, I did a URA (undergrad research assistantship) with Craig. It was great learning experience, and it prepared me for cs488 to some degree. Check uw.cs.ugrad at the beginning of each team to find out URA opportunities!",
      "Course ain't easy, but Kaplan makes already interesting material come alive. Never seriously thought about grad school till this class.",
      "An amazing prof. I am going to try and take a graphics course just to get him again. He knows C++ so well that it's staggering. Very helpful and knowledgable. Prepares well for class. If you get him you are in for a treat. (the assmts are interesting too!)",
      "Easily, one of the best CS profs. His presentation style is both engaging and funny. He knows his material and is genuinely concerned for each and every one of his students. He will reply to any and all questions posted on the newsgroup instantaneously. The midterm was fair but the final was harder.",
      "Enthusiastic, funny, clear, patient... Gives lots of real-life examples, and posts very prompt newsgroup responses, too. CS 246 has a lousy reputation, but Kaplan made it a blast. Seriously, this guy deserves some kind of award. Sign up for his class if you get the chance -- you won't regreat it.",
      "As an exchange student, most of my courses have been crap, CS246 is the one exception. His fun and terrible jokes (in a good way) make it entertaining and educational!",
      "Craig is awsome! Hands down, he's my favourite undergrad professor and he has made cs488 my favourite CS course. Funny like Troy Vasiga, but much much nicer and patient than Troy during office hours. Highly recommended course and teacher!",
      "Simply the best. Best course I ever took with the best prof I ever had - a perfect combination.",
      "Outstanding professor. I knew nothing about graphics, and not only did he teach well, but he made me care about it (even radiosity balancing...)",
      "The absolute best there is. This is some high quality instruction! Entertaining and smart. Made one of the 'big 3' courses fun to take! He held my interest even when teaching quaternions!",
      "This man is the best!! The only cross-faculty course I've ever taken turns out to have had the best prof I've ever had. He should definitely be recognized in some way. Go Kaplan!!",
      "Excellent! Without a doubt the best prof I've had in my undergrad. Jokes around during class but still manages to teach the material perfectly. This man deserves some kind of award... excellent."

      "Good prof, available for help when you need it",
      "Explains everything very well and clearly. Give challenging assignments.",
      "Excellent professor. Very well organized course, that made me feel like I learned a lot of useful ways of thinking through problems. He is immensely intelligent, and uses that to its full effect to get all material across to its students.",
      "Clearest explanations ever!",
      "Great prof! Very difficult course, but he's kept me on the edge of my seat for it.",
      "Great class. Assignments sometimes too easy - could benefit from bonus problems I think to stimulate those that want to be stimulated. Lectures were fantastic coherent and well organized. I recommend this prof to ANYONE taking algorithms.",
      "Great prof, awesome class. I'd recommend it for anyone that enjoyed CS341.",
      "THE BEST prof I've ever had! very funny, passionate, nice, and made the course extremely easy ^^",
      "Timothy is one of the best Algorithms professors in the school. Assignments were generally pretty fair and the midterm was a tad on the long side, but he can teach REALLY well.",
      "Very very tough assignments. Insane lectures. Exams are OK. Got a lower mark than I expected (70-something, was hoping for 80+). Still, I learned a lot, and Chan knows what he's doing. I can say I'm an Algorithmic master now",
      "Notes are very clear. Too bad he's a jerk",
      "Amazing prof! I love his style of teaching. His only problem is that he is going too slow. The exams were pretty easy. Assignments would be hard if not for the hints he gave.",
      "Interesting Prof, work very hard to make the material clear, another point of attending his class is to check out the guy whose hair has the highest reflectivity in UW.",
      "Excellent explanations and clear notes. Very good pace most of the time and very well organized. Assignments required some thought but were easy to do because of hints he gave in the questions. Easy midterm, fair exam.",
      "He teaches you how to think! Great class! And use the office hours",
      "very enthusiastic to be teaching! does not over complicate material, gives lots of great examples and excellent notes. really liked him.",
      "This guy is enthuasiatic. I love his enthusiasm in class and that keeps me listening and learning. His notes are all you need to study from. Course itself is not overly difficult but some of the assignments were tough. I still got by ok probably because of Tim.",
      "Tim Chan is the man. I would not have survived cs341 if it weren't for him.",
      "Enthusiastic way of teaching. Makes the lectures more interesting with him using the board to teach rather than slides. Good examples to teach a concept.",
      "Inspiring enthusiasm for the material ensures the classes attention during lectures. Classes are gripped to every word. Great prof! algorithms classes arent for those who wont put in ALOT of time though.",
      "Did a great job of teaching a boring course. Was energetic, moved at a managable pace, and did a good job of keeping the class interested.",
      "Great prof... very funny and entertaining.. made going to lecture fun and interesting.. Made algorihtms easier to understand!",
      "Great Prof! Makes hard concepts and proofs easy to understand. Even though some of my friends who took it from other profs were saying this course was hard, my friends and I who took it from him didn't find it difficult at all!",
      "Great course, makes the material interesting. Very organized and explained the topics clearly.",
      "Outstanding prof for CS 341. He knows how to teach, keeps you listening also. The course was done very well overall, assignments returned on time etc.",
      "Very clear explanations. Breaks down difficult proofs and algorithms into manageable bits. Always uses examples to illustrate how algorithms work. I enjoyed the course despite expectations to the contrary, which were based on my CS 240 experiences.",
      "Excellent prof. Had an amazing grasp on the material, and presented the most difficult concepts with the ease that only a veteran could. Made the material jump out at you. I totally enjoyed algorithms because of this guy.. take algos with him if you can.",
      "Good at teaching tough material. Lectures are aimed at the average CS student rather than the top few percent, which makes it easier to follow.",
      "Man, this guy is funny as hell!!! Cracks odd jokes at great moments and makes the class go fast. I never miss his class. Unfortunatley he gives totally useless hints during his office hours.",

      "She is a very good prof. Her accent is of no problem. She edifies the course so good. I had so much problems in the cs 135, but in her class i did great, and got a 91 in mid. Assignments became so easy, as i listened carefully to all her lectures. Never gets pissed off for ques. Replies back even at night times. So kind and good.",
      "She is so nice! Always willing to help and really cares about her students. She pushes you to think and be creative, instead of just telling you the answer. Her explanations of the concepts are really clear. Definitely recommend.",
      "Best CS prof ever! She is very caring and always available after class. She is so kind and patient. Never regret to take her class.",
      "Great professor. Turned cs246 from a killer course to a doable 80 with amazing support and good lectures. She really really cares about her students.",
      "Really nice professor with humour, patience, kindness and a lot of help outside of class. Strongly recommend you to take her classes.",
      "She is the best prof I have had up to date! I highly recommend her.",
      "Greattt! She prepared great lectures with detailed examples. Very clear and highly organized. She would also send the examples used in class to students which made me only need to concentrate on the screen and not just copied it down. And the best part is that she replied email quickly and even answered Qs on weekends. Patient and helpful!",
      "One of the most caring profs at UW. Literally begs people to come to her office hours because she wants to make sure everyone succeeds. Does have an accent but it doesn't hinder the lectures at all, she teaches every lecture clearly and concisely.",
      "She makes the class seem so easy... Don't worry about people who say she has an accent. She explains very well if you're willing to listen.",
      "SHE IS FANTASTIC. She is ALWAYS willing to go above and beyond to help students. Incredible.",
      "Prof. Sakhnini is the best.",
      "I Love her. She is the best Wish to have her for all of my courses.",
      "I thought she was great. She replaced my CS 115 lecturer for a lecture and she was soooo much better. She explained everything so clearly and it made me not want to quit on CS.",
      "Super great teaching style - she always uses the blackboard to explain concepts, and she continuously repeats things to drill into your head. Great at answering questions. Super caring and funny!",
      "Very nice and helpful! Her accents do not affect her lecture at all. I think her explanations are more clear than many profs with North American accents.",
      "Dr. Sakhnini is a nice professor. She knows her stuff well, and is very good at explaining the concepts. Although some students have problem with her accent in beginning, I wasn't among them. However, the exams were very difficult for an introductory course. Furthermore, they were graded tough too. Overall, I would surely recommend taking this prof",
      "Definitely a good prof! Really helpful and her lectures are super clear!",
      "Amazing, caring professor. She explained things in a very logical way and communicated with the class often; you would leave every lecture completely understanding the content. She clearly cared about her students, and would go above and beyond to make sure they understood everything.",
      "Great Prof. Caring, amazing, and very good at teaching.",
      "Sick prof. Get ready to get LIT in class.",
      "Her lectures are amazing and she can always keep you interested. I love her personality since she makes students feel very welcomed to come to her/ask questions. Note: if u r ESL, she might be a TINY bit hard to understand. Her accent was okay to me but not okay to some people I know.",
      "Very enthusiastic prof, even if she is teaching computer science. Unlike some professors, she is definitely there for the students and to teach. Clearly loves her job; however, the lectures are long but I believe that's the concepts fault, not hers.",
      "She is an amazing professor. She is always looking to help students out. Her teaching style is perfect and is an overall funny person.",
      "Great prof. Explains concepts very well and gives many examples. Our section had the highest average on both midterm and finals. Definitely recommend this prof.",
      "Excellent prof. She explains concepts very clearly, despite the accent. If you can focus and understand her, she is amazing. CS115 is an easy course to begin with, but attending the lectures definitely helped.",
      "Great prof who seems to really love what she's teaching. She explains everything clearly and gives lots of examples. The class is based mostly off the courseware notes so I recommend getting them! If you have little/no programming experience she's a great prof to have because her lectures have a really good pace and she is very approachable.",
      "Best prof ever. Go to lectures be active.",
      "Although her lectures are sometimes hard to follow, she is amazing at helping people out. She not only gives us reasons based on the course itself, but gives us reasons based on the student's mentality as well.",
      "Great professor, great person. Everything is clear and coherent. At any time she is willing to assist students. Would love to take a class with her again.",
      "One of the best profs at UW. really helpful and clear explanations to the concepts. Take her if you have chance.",
      "She offered to skype students who needed help up until the exam. Big heart, little bit of an accent, solid prof. Free online textbook, which isn't even necessary, but don't buy your own textbook.",
      "She's a very nice person, but a little bland during lectures. I found it difficult to stay focused during class. However, she really wanted the students to succeed and always offered help.",

      "I like her teaching style",
      "Does her best. Helpful & energetic.",

      "enthusiastic professor. nice person and does her best",
      "Great professor, helpful, knowledgeable and caring.",
      "She seems like a great person, but unfortunately her accent does bother me a bit. On the other hand she is super helpful and energetic, which I really appreciate. Wouldnt mind having her again!",
      "One of the best professors!",
      "She's super nice. :)",
      "It's 8pm, Saturday night, wo days before the final and she is willing to answer our questions by email. what a dedicated professor.",

      "professor Sakhnini made me change my mind and start enjoying cs courses. yes she has an accent, but this is true for all professors whose English is not their native language. the important part is that she knows how to teach and how to explain the content in a clear and understandable way. I wish to have her as my professor in other cs courses",
      "I never thought that an instructor can make such a difference in understanding cs115, I recommend her class for every student that is struggling with cs115, just try her",
      "an excellent teacher. Does her best to make complex terms easy to understand. She tries her best to help us and she cares for our success",
      "Don't like her accent... She tries her best to explain things though."

A true lad and great teacher.",

      "Prof. Brecht is a truly caring professor. On the first day he starts off with something that no other prof does; he tells the class that he'll learn their names by the end of the term. Although he ended up learning only about 3 4 names by the end, it showed that he cared for the students. Coupled with this, he answered questions very thoroughly.",
      "The best Tim Brecht of all!",
      "Funny guy. Very knowledgeable. Great at explaining the concepts. He's taught this course many times, and he's good at it. I would highly recommend taking the course with Brecht if you can.",
      "I think prof. Brecht really wants his students to do well, and he actually is pretty nice. Hard exams, when he says to \"know everything\" for the midterm, he means EVERYTHING. I really couldn't ask for a better prof for this very difficult course.",
      "The tests are harder than some, but are based off a lot of the in class discussions. So if you go to class you shouldn't have too much of a problem. Sometimes he mixes up terms like bits/bytes but overall he's a good prof, especially for such a core class like CS 350.",
      "He is my favourite professor..I wasn't going to register his course but after attending the first lecture, i couldn't drop the course! He is talented in creating an interesting discussion that engages everyone in the class. Attending his class is a real fun..Also, he treats us as a father that tries to teach us sincerely without spoiling us.",

      "Well, due to no fault of his, this course is just tough. Especially if you have limited to no experience in C or C++. Waterloo has basically stripped C/C++ and it made it a lot harder for me this term seeing as I only had basic exposure. As a professor, very nice and friendly person. Explanations at beginning of term were tough but became easier",
      "Finally a prof who can speak English! Knows the material very well and keeps the class interesting with his enthusiasm.",
      "Top notch. Interesting lectures. Good examples. Helpful in and out of class.",
      "Knows his stuff VERY well, but sometimes gets stuck explaining useless things to uber-nerds who ask questions which are not relevant to the course. Than proceeds to hurry to finish the lecture. His midterm/exam is hard and he is a very bad marker. The semester I took it the midterm average was 52, that after a bell of 8%. Very Helpful though!",
      "Good clear explanations. Good with questions. Excellent.",
      "One of the best. Very helpful with assignments too.",
      "Interesting lectures. Keeps us interested. Very helpful and clear.",

      "Excellent lectures. Clear explanations. Answers questions well.",
      "good clear lectures",
      "Great prof, knows his stuff but the problem is the stuff is hard. Even if he's a good lecturer, you usually lost somewhere because material is hard to visual at first. Also, expects alot from students.",
      "Excellent, clear, interesting, lectures",
      "Great prof, helpful to students, shows a lot of respect for students. Definately take a class with him.",
      "GREAT. Very clear explanations. Goes way beyond what's written in the course notes, with practical examples. Good treatment of students' questions, although he sometimes makes up answers if he isn't sure. (But who cares&#63; They always make sense anyway!)",

      "Even in a large class, he made it a mission to learn everyone's names; which is rare in profs. He's a talented and helpful prof and if you don't understand it afterwards, you should be in CS 131. UW should clone him and make him teach every CS class",
      "Good lectures, was helpful and energetic.",
      "Committed prof.",
      "Sometimes goes off on long tangents about curing cancer and stuff, sometimes teaches a bit above your level, but super excited about teaching and loves students",
      "good voice",
      "Great guy, very helpful. Very knowlegable. Expects too much from students though. Course was difficult though, and the assignments weren't fun, but I blame the Deparment for that!!",

      "I really enjoyed her class and exceptional teaching style. take her courses if you can - you will not regret it. Her lectures were 4-5:30 on Fridays!!!! but I did not miss a class. Very enjoyable. I learned a lot from her course.",
      "Suzanne is wonderful! I normally don't do these but everyone should know how great Suzanne are. It was super useful and very easy to retain. Her in-class participation examples are very helpful for the exams. Make sure you pick a good group for the assignment. If you need help, go to her office hours and she'll make sure you're on the right path.",
      "Great prof and good course",
      "I took both CS 430 and 432 with her. CS432~ she was good. CS 430~ kill me! She is a hard, hard marker and even though you explain what you did and why it may be correct, she will NOT agree. Basically her way or the highway. Other than that, she is okay. Take her. Nothing wow... just take it",
      "Awesome prof, if you show up to every class and keep up, you will do great. She isn't easy, but I'm not buying marks, I'm buying the chance to learn, and get a degree that actually means something. If UW profs were easy, then our degrees would mean nothing. She tries hard to make a boring subject interesting, and does a good job at it.",
      "Great prof and very usefull course",
      "Took both CS430/432. If you keep up with the work (which is not difficult), you will enjoy any term where you have her as your prof :). It also helps to be fluid with English, because she will get somewhat irritated if you are not clear (aka asian) with your communication! Great prof, were the only 2 courses I actually enjoyed.",
      "I took both cs 430 and 432 from Suzanne this term. I had her back to back for almost 3 hours. She did a superb job in both courses. always well prepared, very enrgetic, good examples and great delivery. I don't know my marks yet, but I am confident I did well in both courses and I learned a lot from these 2 courses.",
      "Excellent teacher and great course. I learned a lot from this course and suzanne did superb job teaching it. Wish i could take more courses from her. She cares about her students.",
      "She is the BEST. I was her TA and also took her course. She is the best prof I've had at UW. Treats students with respect and is very friendly and approachable. I love her teaching style -knowledgable, clear, good examples. I will be taking cs 430 with her next term. If she is teaching the course take it, you will not regret it.",
      "Did CS 430 and 432 with her in winter '09. Best prof. ever.I can bet on that!Very caring and friendly, excellent teaching,great sense of humour.Is always ready to help, even way outside her office hours.You see her name against a course, just enroll.You would love her and her way of teaching, guaranteed!!",
      "Useful course, great Prof, and fair exam. She really cares about her students ? answered my email question, even on weekends. Used excellent examples, related to our coop jobs, so we could relate the course material to our job experience. I?ll be taking 432 in Fall & I hope she will be teaching it.",
      "Took both 430 & 432 from her this term. Enjoyed both courses. Very useful & practical courses. Just did a job interview last week & found out today I have a job as business analyst. Used lot of things I learned in these 2 courses during interview. Excelle prof. treated everybody nicely but did not take BS from some students who were totaly lost",
      "CS 430 may have been itty easier than CS 432, but Prof Safayeni is terrific for both courses. These courses are not too difficult if you do the assignments and read through the notes a few times. There is a lot of memory work involved, but the prof is always available for help if needed. Wish she taught more CS courses!",
      "Prof Safyeni is awesome. I bugged her for help a lot outside of class, and she was always available. Though I did fall asleep a few times during her lecture, I think that was due to the boring subject matter as opposed to her actual lecturing. She is a great prof, and I look forward to taking another class with her.",
      "the course was boring although she tried to make it interesting",
      "CS 432 was a good course and the prof did a good job. Lot of work but I learned a lot. She is very friendly and always available to help.",
      "she knows her stuff. Very helpful prof.",
      "This is the first computer course i've taken in my life..and Suzanne made the concepts very clear. Although the lectures are a bit dry (how can you sit in class learning how to use a computer&#63;) she is a great prof and actually cares about the students!",
      "She is a great prof. Knows her subject, treats the students very well, gives fair exams. She made the course useful & interesting. I had her for CS 430 and can not wait to take her second course.",
      "I had Suzanne as a prof and as an advisor. She is the most caring person & excellent prof. I finally learned about database after taking her course. She works hard teaching her courses & expects a serious work from her students.",
      "The good news is that both courses are among the easiest in the Math faculty (unless you want a 90). The bad news is the hardest part of the course is going to class and listening to her ramble on and on and on. Also take CS 432, but don't take CS 430 'cause 432 is a LOT more interesting.",
      "Don't take this class unless you want to be bored with drawing silly diagrams. Although she knows the material it's still insanely dull",
      "Very nice, Unclear sometimes but very helpful if you go to her a couple of days before midterms and assignment. could be a really **** if you always go to her in the last minute.",
      "She knows her stuff, does excellent job teaching and treats students very good. But does not take BS from anybody. Really enjoyed her courses. Thank you Suzanne. Keep up the good work.",
      "Very helpful - Cares about students, keeps night class interesting. Few annoying students in class who ask irrelevant questions & she puts them in their place. She doesn't let those who are not interested to waste class time.Helpful during office hours - of course does not repeat the whole lecture",
      "She's very nice and approachable. Final exam is VEVERY LONG though.",

Super knowledgeable and very patient at answering students' program problems after class, gives very factual, useful hints on the assignments. His lecture is very coherent and organized, great use of blackboard. Tries to learn students' names, very approachable. Take OS with him!",
      "If you are going to take CS350, take Ken's. He is definitely the best CS350 instructor on campus.",
      "Best prof I've ever had at UW. Would definitely recommend!",

      "Really great prof. Super clear lectures, makes everything make sense. Better than Tim Brecht for OS in my opinion. He doesn't yell at anyone I don't know what these people are on about. He doesn't always respond to questions if they're interrupting while he's talking but he always waits for questions between thoughts.",
      "Extremely well-organized and makes a real effort to ensure that students understand the concepts being conveyed in the class. Will go out of his way to explain ideas and does it with impeccable clarity. Fast in responding to emails and discussion postings as well. Tests are reasonable in difficulty and extremely fair in content coverage.Go KEN!",

Ken is one of the persons that are so critical for my carrer. The longer since I left waterloo, the more I am grateful to him and his lectures.",

There were times I couldn't make his office hours and he took out his own time to let me come in by appointment. Always replies to emails within 24 hours. If you plan to take CS448, take it with Ken Salem!",
      "Crystal lectures. Very well organized course. Really knows his stuff. Answers ALL student questions inside and outside class. Overall very helpful, knowledgeable prof. If you take CS448, take Salem's class.. I can't see why there are so many slanderous comments here. Notice all older ratings are great. Seems just 1 OS section decided to be trolls.",
      "One of Best CS prof Ive had so far. The lectures were very clear. Only negative thing is that it isnt too hard to fall asleep in the lecture.",

On top of that, he really knows how to teach! I think some bitter student wrote all these negative comments.",

      "Khuzaima is an amazing prof - teaches well, with lots of examples and cares about the material and students learning. The few complainers (where's your integrity?) can't take the fact that the course is over so they don't need Piazza or the course material anymore.",

      "He is really good and really care about students. I highly recommend you to take this course. The downside of these course is that so many people copying from past terms' assignment solutions (a1 and a4) since they have not been modified for terms. But the grade distribution is unfair for those who actually went to class and learned things.",

      "The coding assignments are fun; there's usually a group one that takes a bit longer. The written assignments are often very vague in what they want, and you should probably right more than you think you need to. His lectures are clear and interesting but he doesn't explicitly state a lot of things, wants to realize things yourself which can be hard",

He is very enthusiastic about what he doing and this in turn transfer to us during class.Also, he is very helpful and respond very fast to emails. I wish to take all my courses with him ;-)",

Really like him...Bothered him a lot last term...Thankful...He is not responsible for the final grade, but i got fairly good grade thanks to his extensive help throughout the term(although I had no programming experience b4)",

Besides that, he is the most the helpful prof I've had in a long time (stayed behind an extra hour just to answer questions me and another guy had the day before the final). Exams are very fair, and resulted in my highest CS mark ever.",
      "This prof was good, and he made the course interesting. He augmented the lousy text extensively, particularly in the 2nd half with good notes on the board. He was committed to teaching well: thanks for the effort! This course would have been boring otherwise...",
      "I maybe paid attention in class for about five minutes a session, but despite that I think the prof is solid. The textbook is excellent, the slides seemed ripped out of there except for a few sections, and the prof does a good (through not rip-roaring) job of going through them and filling in necessary little bits. Course too good for his good :)",

      "I wasn't sure how this course would turn out but thanks to this prof, I have really enjoyed it. He teaches enthusiatically and knows his stuff, and he answers questions with ease. I like how he uses slides and the board to teach. Also a nice guy to talk to.",
      "This prof definitely knows his stuff, and he presents material clearly. He answers questions well and treats questions from students with respect. He is quite a bit better than a lot of the other UW profs.",

His exams were fair and lecture were very interesting. However he tends to be very fast and all over the place on the board so it can be difficult to follow.",

      "Take CS245 with him if you can. It will make your life so much easier. Best prof I've ever had.",
      "If you are talking CS 245 with him, you are in for a treat. Tonnes of useful examples covered in class make understanding material and studying for exams easy. His assignments were also very reasonable, although I felt they were bit too straightforward.",
      "Out of all the radically different CS 245 offerings (approaches / presented material vary wildly term to term), Peter Van Beek's is by far the best. Useful material, with just the right amount of theory to back it up. Fair midterm and assignments, tough final (IMO), always potential to earn part-marks makes it easy to pass the course. Recommended!!",
      "his handwriting is awful. he is amazing everything else. exam was very fair.",
      "This prof looks and talks funny. He give the best summary handouts for this course. All the hard inference rules that this course cover are summarized into a few sheets which he will give you on the exam. He made this course look very easy. However, his writing is not very neat and his voice is a bit low. He forgets to turn on the mike many times.",
      "Prof speaks very clearly and writes all relevant material on the board. He is also very helpful during office hours. Excellent CS 245 prof.",
      "His voice is soothing and he is easy to look at. Brilliant prof who teaches everything you need to know for assignments and exams in his classes. Attend class and focus = a passing mark. Will look for him again. The dude is gold, seriously.",
      "One of the best proffesors I've had. Extremely interesting subjects which he teach very well. Can't but recommend CS486!",
      "the greatest professor in computer science!! truly nice person, always care about his students, he is the best!!!",
      "Highly recommand his CS486 course: Organized material, fair amount of work and high marks. I personally think this is the best undergrad cs course in uw",
      "His assignments are easy and there's no midterm...But the exam is a bit hard (but they base on the assignments)...I recommend this...",
      "Great prof, very straight forward and helpful. Totally recommend his CS245 and CS486 classes.",
      "Mostly, the course is about style and semantics, following the proper proof structures. First half of course is easy; second half is a terror with the length of proofs, so the final hits a lot of people hard. Prof is cheerful, energetic, fun; course is fair, even. Only issues: no material respository (textbook, course notes), 8:30 class!",
      "Course is a typically UW CS course - completely useless. Van Beek is good, but that course is depressing as $#&%, and it just reminds you of how pathetic UW CS has become. Thanks folks.",
      "Regarding the last comment: how do you know the class average after the final is that low&#63; The final exam was easy in my opinion, and I ended up with the same grade I went in with. Just because you were underprepared and expected the exam to be easy since the material was easy does not mean that everyone was 'raped' by the final.",
      "Gayest class on earth. Avoid if possible. Easy as hell material, but absolutely RAPES you on the final. Class avg going in was ~85%, coming out 68%. Final was worth 50%, do the math. (avg on final was 50%).",
      "Great professor! Very clear teaching style, and I find his voice somewhat relaxing. Highly recommended!",
      "one of the nicest profs at UW, very concise and helpful lectures and notes, u dun never need a textbook or course notes provided u go to his lectures and take his notes. midterm was really easy and it's likely he gave the same short questions for 3 terms :-)",
      "Very clear lecturing style. His lectures were very laid-back, yet he still managed to dismiss us 5 minutes early in some lectures. Midterm was easy (avg. 80%) but final was killer (I'm guessing an avg. of 50-60%). Still, the end class average was probably ~70%. On a side note, he's one of the nicest and most helpful CS profs I've ever had.",
      "The average class was too high so he tried to kill us on the final exam ... However, van Beek is a great prof, really nice notes, very clear and concise and very helpful ! would love to take AI with him",
      "Relaxing and enjoyable class. One of the most fun to take.",
      "An outstanding prof who taught AI very well. Note that class attendance is necessary to do well in the course so if you tend to miss classes you might have some trouble.",
      "He teaches well and is extremely helpful in office hours. Assignments are fairly easy, but the exam requires quick thinking. The exam is also difficult to study for since, aside from the assignments, there aren't any practice problems.",
      "favorite cs class of my undergrad career, hands down",
      "Clear explanations, good coverage, reasonable assignments, fair grades. Just watch for the final - it's no harder than the assignments, but you need to practice beforehand.",
      "Brilliant prof teaching an easy course. The course is a walk in the park, but the difficulty was unevenly distributed. He had to make the final hard to make up for the easy midterm and assignments (otherwise 87%+ class average!) I'd look for him again.",
      "Very organized. Teaches thoroughly. Easy to follow. The material itself is easy. Midterm was very easy so the final was really hard. Assignments were also very easy. Compared to previous 245 prof (Nancy Day) he is much easier.",
      "Very easy prof. I think that the course could be harder but with the kind of assignments he gives you, it's pretty easy. Explanations are clear and notes are good. Midterms marks were too high so the final was killer.",
      "Easy course, he goes through things at a good pace and is clear and concise.",
      "Clear explanations, fair exams, good marks. Take CS 486 with him.",

His english is not 100% so that is sometimes a barrier though. Course is not too hard just come to lectures and pay attention.",

The only thing is the assignment statement is not very clear and one of the TA is marking in a SUPER MEAN manner and that TA is not really willing to help at office hour.

Super entertaining lectures, and very good at explaining more complex topics. If you're at all scared about pointers, definitely take his class.",
      "Best CS prof in Waterloo I've ever met. Teaching so well!",

He will often joke about Piazza, but he actually really cares about students with questions. Overall a fantastic prof, do make sure to attend his lectures.",
      "He is literally the prof that I like the most from Waterloo!!! I'm not from his session, but I go to his session all the time, coz he's so nice, he's the kind of prof that really, really, I MEAN REALLY care about his student (so does Alice!), even though I always bother him with my problems after class, he's always there with incredible patience!!!",

      "I've always liked cs but I'm a very mediocre student, yet 246 has been my best and favorite course so far. Lectures are great and worth going 8:30 am. Nomair gives great feedback and keeps the class interesting. Best prof I've had in Waterloo so far, more than a prof he's a bro. 1110 would take again",
      "Nomair has to be one of the coolest instructors I've had. Object Oriented Programming with him was real fun. Really helpful outside of class, and cares about his students. Plus, he gave out candy on halloween (and to numb the pain from our midterm grades) and even timbits later on during the semester. Pretty awesome prof.",

Address questions amazingly, and is able to give you answers that go well beyond the level of the course. This man knows everything about CS and people. You are doing yourself by selecting another prof over him. 1010",

He occasionally gives handouts which are extremely useful. He explains very clearly and answers questions very well. The assignments are well designed and fun, so must do it. He gives out chocolates in class!",
      "They hold your hand through the entire course. Big portions of the assignment questions are laid out in class. Going to tutorials will answer even more assignment questions. Exams are short and a breeze, but some facts only mentioned in class (not covered on assignments) will show up.",

      "Fantastic, really, really great, likely my favourite prof so far in my undergrad. Extremely helpful in lectures, office hours, over email. Teaches well in lectures. Pretty entertaining, funny, good to listen to, and she has some pretty interesting stories. Has been an undergrad at UW and taken this course before so very relatable and understanding.",
      "One of the best profs at Waterloo imo.",
      "One of the better profs I have had. She really cares about you and helps you out whenever she can.",
      "Lesley is super clear, super competent, and her lectures come with the bonus of some absolutely hilarious jokes. Tons of relevant experience in CS, and she's been at Waterloo a really long time, so she really gets students. A++",
      "The world needs to figure out how to produce more profs like her.",
      "Great prof. Actually very knowledgeable about what she teaches. It is great when you can ask a question get the real world answer, instead of the dumbed down one for the course. Is very considerate of your time and doesn't waste it. Very good summaries of content posted on Pizza. Very active on Piazza. Go to class for OS of the day. Recommended.",
      "Lesley is awesome. She's been studying CS at UW for a really long time, and she totally understands what it's like to be a student here. It's really obvious from her lectures how knowledgeable she is, and it seems like she cares about her students and is genuinely passionate about what she does. 11/10 would take a class with her again.",
      "I love her class, she does an amazing job in answering everyone's questions, shes super enthusiastic about the course material and its sort of infectious and really helps with getting focused in class and actually caring about what you're learning. Oh and not to mention shes great with real world applications, and talks about a real world OS every",
      "Lesley is an awesome lecturer! Speaks clearly, keeps the class engaged by starting off the lectures with an \"Operating System of the Day\" history lesson. She's super helpful during office hours and great with responding to questions via email. I enjoyed the lectures so much I sat through them twice :) 10/10 would recommend Lesley if you're able!",
      "From my 4 years at the University of Waterloo, Lesley is by far the best prof I've come across. CS350 is known to have tough material, but Lesley made the course really engaging and interesting for me. Her explanations were very clear and she covered the concepts very well. It's obvious her intention is for students to perform their best.",
      "One of the best profs I've had. Makes what was otherwise an unbearable and impossibly difficult course (for me) manageable and I may finally pass this course haha. Would definitely recommend for CS350 or for any course.",
      "Good prof.",
      "Great prof. Has a great personality and works hard to help her students do well. CS 240 is a painful course with a lot of work, but everything on her end is done well.",
      "Lesley was one of the greatest profs I've ever had! She makes class an absolute bomb with her nerd jokes. 10/10 would take 241 with her again.",
      "I would giver her a 6 out of 5 if I could!! I'd like to point out what made here one of the best CS135 professors: 0.)She is Cool!! 1.)She Made Extra problems which were INCREDIBLY USEFUL! 2.) It was clear, she cared! 3.)She Loved Teaching! Her enthusiasm was evident! 4.)She related things we were learning, with real world applications!",
      "Lesley is very funny and very likable. Sometimes she gets sidetracked during lectures. You learn computer science more by doing than by explanation, but her explanations are on point. You can tell she's very knowledgeable.",
      "Lesley was very good in some ways, but also a little bad in others. She was really amazing at giving real world examples which made it more interesting but we always seemed to be behind the lecture slides because of it. She also did implement her own functions a lot which was nice. Overall she was pretty good, she's better than other cs profs",
      "She gives real life examples of how things we do in class can be applied.",
      "She teaches pretty clearly but she doesn't like the language she is teaching because she thinks (like students) that it's a stupid language to use. Since she has been working in big companies for some time now (at least she says that she has) She finds lot of things that she teaches in the class dumb. She randomly will tell how she burned her comp"

      "Lap Chi was one of the best CS profs I've had at UW. It really showed how much he cared that we learned. He had very good hand-written notes available online before class. He structured the content for programming and proof-style content for assignments and made sure there were bonus marks on almost everything. Really enjoyed the course due to him",
      "Great proof for an algorithm course!",
      "Always here for help, answered almost each question on piazza which was explained ambiguously by students. For myself, i'm not good at algorithms, but will attend his other courses if have any chances.",
      "Best prof ever in UW",
      "Energetic and engaging. Has a thorough understanding of algorithms and often asks the class for ideas to a problem before presenting the solution. Found him pretty funny, but I figure the humor mostly falls on deaf ears. You can probably learn the entire course from the notes he posts, but missing any lecture would be a tragedy.",
      "Literally the best prof I have ever had for any course at the University of Waterloo. He really cares about the students' success and his teaching is very clear. I would love to take another course with this wonderful man.",
      "Wonderful prof with lovely accent. Difficulty for lots of programming questions.",
      "Just want to mention my difficulty rating may be due to poor performance in the prerequisite courses. Lectures have a TON of useful information, some of which isn't in the notes he posts. Solid proff with a good attitude.",
      "Lap Chi Lau is an amazing prof. He has clearly spent a lot of time preparing the lectures and determining the best way to teach the content. He doesn't waste your time in lectures so you should attend them. Also very active on Piazza and is willing to dive in and help if you get lost. Also his assignments are actually interesting and relevant.",
      "The. Best. Professor. At. UW. (especially for an algorithms course). Such an inspiring, humble, and exceptionally talented prof. 3",
      "He is an inspiration to life",
      "I recommend going to class instead of reading through his notes. Although the notes are great, they introduced lots of concepts that are not discussed in class. Good prof, love his teaching style.",
      "Great prof that teaches you a lot useful algorithms",
      "I believe students that attend classes liked his teaching. For those that don't attend lectures, they liked his notes. Lectures are a bit dull but very clear. Good piazza responses and gives assignment hints on the last day.",
      "He is an excellent prof. He is friendly and respects his students. His assignments are hard, but he is extremely helpful if you need help. The exams are hard, but the marking is fair. His notes are detailed and one of the best algorithms notes that you can find. Overall I highly recommend him.",
      "The best prof an algorithms course can ever have ! The accent is a little bit hard to catch on at first, but as you go through the course you will love him. Thinks about the students and helps them at any time. Would fail the course to take with him again !!",
      "Very enthusiastic professor!",
      "Although his accent might be tough to understand in the beginning. He goes through each topic slowly and clearly. Which means that you can understand the topic being taught but at the same time it could make the classes feel long and boring. He posts his actual full lecture content in written form online so you can concentrate in class.",
      "Has great clarity of thought, knows his subject really well. CS798 is a tough course to take, but he handled it well. Homework questions help you to understand the course, and the TA and Prof are ready to help you out with understanding the material.",
      "Clear lectures, posts notes before the lectures which is used in the class. Course material is amazing."

      "Great prof - knows the material amazingly well, organized, clear. The only problem is that some of the assignments were nearly impossible.",
      "Overall pretty good at introducing and teaching concepts in a easy to understand way. Often presents interesting problems related to computational geometry (her specialty). Only problem is that she tends to leave a lot of proofs as an &quot;exercise&quot; and uncompleted.",

      "Nice course, with helpful handouts and example programs in matlab, I really like it",

      "HESS SOOO CUTEEE I LOVE HIMMM lol and hes a great teacher",
      "i think hes soo fukin cuteeeee.. hes a geek nerddd who lovessss computerss.. and his butt is kinda nice to stare at when u get bored",
      "he is just amazing, better than a lot other cs profs i know, he really knows his stuff.",
      "EXCELLENT prof 1 of the best for CS134. Goes out of his way to help students. if you ask him anything responds in gr8 detail. Makes geeky jokes but lectures are OUTSTANDING. Does feedback after many lectures to improve lectures and assign,need I say more&",
      "Great prof. His lectures are entertaining for many reasons(glasses and dumb jokes). During the lectures he has great examples, and demonstrations. Made the class easy.",
      "Good use of visual examples, especially destroying a phone book to demonstrate binary search. Sometimes pace of lectures too fast and he assumes too much. Generally very clear with an excellent presentation style. Recommended prof!",
      "Very helpful, I understand cs so much now, i feel like i'm a micro-processor",
      "Great instructor. His fly was open numerous times this term (S04). What's with his big glasses. CS Sucks!",

I went to his office hours, stayed way over time, he did everything to help and more, since I had a lot of problems with programming in general, I sensed right away that he genuinely cared. Easily the nicest prof I've had. Rock on Ondrej!",
      "Very interesting course, and he's great at explaining it. Although... it can get confusing when he draws diagrams, erases things, adds things... that could use some work. Otherwise, he's super helpful, answers emails, very reasonable guy. Think he's taught this course for many years, so he knows what he's talking about. Assignments can be tedious.",

      "He is the best teacher that I've met. He's very good in teaching and also very helpful outside of his class. If you keep on going to class, you actually don't need a textbook.",
      "Another terrible CS course - needs a textbook (Or PLEASE course notes!!!) for sure. Great prof however. Clear and concise (as humanly possible for CS) and very helpful.",
      "Great Prof!!! I wish all profs were at the same level! However the only courses' minus is the absence of the textbook... hopefully it's gonna be fix soon :)"

I am really appreciated that I have a prof like him for CS350. Note: Tough exam, but OS is a tough course anyway",
      "never seen a prof caring so much about student's learning. Sometimes feel like he's spoiled students too much lol. My favourite prof in CS, no one of. made me love to learn cs350 and tried hard on assignments. midterm is fair if you followed the course well.",
      "his lectures are very clear and interactive",
      "Definitely one of the best profs in CS, if you are taking CS350 just go to his section with no doubt. He is super helpful and always there to help students. Midterm might be a bit tricky, but he just so good that you can't resist attending his lecture (this might the only course that I didn't miss any lecture while I am studying in UW).",

He talks pretty fast, so pay attention in class. Students' god father. He made plaintough materials interesting and applicable! So far my favourite CS prof!",

Relates class material to current industry work (if that matters to you) - but in general, is very passionate about teaching, and makes classes very interesting by encouraging active participation from students.",

      "He is a little dull in his lectures, and he spends way too long on the non-important stuff. However, he is an extremely nice guy, and is VERY helpful in his office hours. If you don't understand anything, go to him in office hours and he'll help you until you get it.",
      "Pascal really knows his material and is dedicated to it. He's also helpful and sincere about it. He wants you to understand the material, not to jump hoops. I suspect he'd re-teach the entire course in his office hours just to make sure about that. I thought the course would be hard, but he induced the same interest he has towards it in me."

Very inspirational, however he is not very active on piazza. His lectures is really amazing!",

      "Amazing professor. The assignments are very tough but if you do them you will do well in the exams.",
      "Fantastic lecturer, does a good job of engaging the class and encouraging everyone to participate. The assignments are quite hard both to offload the content he can't get to due to slower lectures and because he has high expectations, but they're really fun and you learn a lot. The most work I did in any course at UW.",
      "Amazing lecturer, interesting content. He liked to make us work in groups during class to solve problems which was really cool. Assignments are HARD but rewarding and there are a lot of bonus problems. Learned some really cool stuff like PCP theorem and hardness of approximation, randomized algorithms, lowerbound techniques etc.",
      "Great prof! Very friendly and really helpful!",

Expect to spend lots of time on your homework, but know that all of the work you do will greatly help you on your exams.",

He will be missed!",

He holds a lot of office hours and is very helpful in them! It's a shame that the university is losing him because he got a job at Google(but great for him!)",

I went to his office hours and told him I was taking the advanced class the next semester, he lent me one of his books to help get me ready. Great guy!",

      "Excellent overall prof. Funny guy and very good at teaching concepts. CS is pretty hard but he makes it easier. Very good at explaining during officer hours. Only issues I had was that he didn't show up twice during lectures, and cancelled office hours (he holds 3) without posting on the CS website that he wasn't coming.",
      "He was definitely an awesome prof, making the course so much interesting and fun. I decided to go into cs after taking the course with him, and I thank him for having been a great instructor.",
      "Terry lectured through some very tricky computer science concepts with exceptional clarity and comprehensiveness. His lectures were always organized and his board diagrams were really effective at communicating difficult concepts. Attend his sections if you have the opportunity.",
      "He's a good professor. His lectures occasionally have a few jokes and the cats are adorable. What sells me as a student of his is that he holds office hours 3-4 times a week and he is incredibly helpful there. Well done!"

      "Very good prof! Very clear and enthusiastic lectures and just such a positive person. Made a hard class easier.",
      "Great prof. Made 8:30 lectures fun! Also very helpful and understanding of silly mistakes.",
      "Super nice, goes over everything clearly. Would recommend.",
      "new prof - always smiling in class, learned a lot"

      "OK, I had Paul Carter for APSC160 and he was a fantastic prof! Real gem of a guy, it's the course itself that is really challenging especially if you have never coded before. Really do your best to keep up, do all the pre labs and worksheets and screencasts and bitfits and maybe you'll be fine.",
      "Everyone I know loves Paul Carter. Lectures can be dull, but very helpful since he goes over practice problems. He explains material so clearly and has a lovely accent.",
      "i love paul carter. took him for apsc 160. lectures and screencasts are thorough and clear. he's strict with the class but it helps keep the chaos of a 300+ class down. he has a good idea of when the class is struggling and pauses the lecture to help. honestly brightens my day just seeing him walk down main mall :-)",
      "A solid professor. Lectures are generally enthusiastic. It's an easy A+ if you know how to code and you stay on track. However, it is time-consuming, especially the project. Do not skip the lectures. If you miss a lecture, catching up on the material is difficult, since there's no textbook and the readings contain insufficient examples.",
      "Bets Prof. Very clear and never makes mistakes.",
      "He genuinely cares about his students and encourages many questions in class. His lectures are never boring and he clearly knows a lot about what he does.",
      "Take his course... do it",
      "Lots of profs are smart, but Paul not only knows his stuff but he's super easy to understand and just a great educator overall. You can tell he really cares, which is nice too. He also has a really soothing voice.",
      "Paul is an amazing lecturer. He always let's students preread the subject of the day which helps them warm up, then he lectures, then ALWAYS gives time for questions and/or discussions. He is also not afraid to enforce classroom expectations if a student is being disruptive.",
      "One of my favorite prof in UBC! Would definitely take course with him again. He is hilarious, caring, and he is good at explaining topics. CPSC is no easy, but he made it much easier.",
      "One of my favorite profs. He clearly explains every topic and always gives everyone opportunities to ask questions. Assignments, exams were all fair and you can do really well in the class by keeping up with his lectures and the assignments. Great prof",
      "Paul Carter is a good instructor. His teaching & explantion is fast, precise, and clear. However, beware that he is so strict and extremely greedy in terms of grades. That is the only thing I dislike about him. Given an extremely difficult final, he (likely) didn't even scale at all, which ruined your GPA.",
      "Very smart prof! Great lecturer! Understands your questions very quick! Just amazing!",
      "Best CPSC prof I've ever had. If you work hard enough, you will get an easy A.",
      "Great prof!",
      "Not much to say except that Paul Carter is a fantastic prof and you shouldn't miss the chance to learn from him.",
      "Explains concepts very well. Offers to look at your code if you need personal help.",
      "He's great!",
      "An absolutely brilliant instructor. His lectures are amazing, and he clearly explains the course concepts. He is very helpful and truly wants his students to succeed. Truly one of the best instructors I have ever had.",
      "Taking 210 with him was one of my best decisions since college. His lectures were extremely structured, well-paced, and inspirational -- sometimes questions from students ran the entire lecture. This course was enjoyable with reasonable workload and straightforward exams.",
      "He teaches fast but clear. Lecture and labs are a little bit intense but as long you catch up with the course you're OK.... Dr. Carter is GREAT! Very helpful - in the class and office hours... Best prof. eveeeeeeeeeer!",
      "Really clear lecturer and great at explaining tough information. If you ask a question he will give you a thoughtful answer. Excellent prof.",
      "Best in the business.",
      "took apsc 160, cpsc 110 and cpsc 210 with professor carter. amazing lecturer and will always be there for you if you need any assistance. will also teach you material beyond the scope of the course in a very detailed manner if you attend the office hours. thanks for amazing lectures and i really wish that you taught higher cpsc courses.",
      "been taking apsc 160, cpsc 110 and cpsc 210 with paul. amazing professor who always helps you learn material beyond the scope if you attend his office hours. very clear and easy-to-follow lectures. thanks for great lectures paul, i wish you taught higher cpsc courses.",
      "Super nice guy! Always asks if you have questions and makes sure you understand the material. The course itself was not bad, try not to leave your project to the last minute. Assignments are very easy, midterms and final are fair (just study major concepts). I absolutely hated 110 and did not want to take 210, but Paul made it enjoyable.",
      "SO GOOD! Great at explaining things, packs his lectures with information and makes students follow along always taking questions. Also answered questions on the online course platform very quickly. (This was an in-person course with Piazza and Coursera)",
      "Really helpful prof, super clear explanations and encourages participation and loads of questions. Recommend everyone to take his class.",
      "Explain things very clearly. He's also very patient and helpful, if you want to take CPSC 110, choose his lecture!I even want to major in CS now!",
      "He is amazing",
      "Best prof ever!!",
      "Good professor. But.. he basically goes through problems that are already posted online (with solutions). Organized slides, everything's cool. The course however, is brutal. Stay on top of everything or else you're doomed. Don't dig yourself into a hole...",
      "Prof Carter is very clear about everything ( his students know clearly what to do and what to expect all the time ). His screencasts capture the most important points. His exercises and labs are helpful and exams are fair. Overall, Prof carter is an amazing professor !",
      "His screencasts are exactly what you need to understand the course. As long as you regularly watch and understand them, you can learn the class without actually going to class. That's how great they are! His assessments (labs and quizzes) are as straightforward as you can get in terms of applying the subject matter. Nice and simple.",
      "Paul keeps the lectures interesting. His screencasts and lectures go over everything you need to know. he is organized and as long as you pay attention, take notes and practise coding every now and then its easy to get a good mark in his class.",
      "Great professor. I entered the class with basically no interest in programming and left finding it interesting. The course workload is reasonable and I literally have not had to use the textbook at all. Paul Carter is very good at explaining things and is always willing to help if you have questions.",
      "Was very helpful and explained what he did if people needed more help. Always tried to engage the lecture hall. Need to know how to problem solve, but no prior programming knowledge in necessary. Need clicker.",
      "Great prof, a favorite so far. Very systematic teaching style, and will go out of his way to help students. Easy to understand. However do try to dodge his \"constructive criticism\".",
      "CPSC 210 itself was a bit of a disappointment, but Paul is the best instructor I've had in my life. The majority of the computer science department at UBC is wonderful, but I don't think it gets much better than Paul, his explanations are crystal clear and he's better at answering questions than anyone I've seen. I very highly recommend him.",
      "Crystal clear.",
      "Really good teacher, he's a little strict but he has control of the class. My favorite first year professor.",
      "He is a good prof, but it's just the course that's brutal..... I don't suggest to take CPSC 210, unless it's your requirement, but, for sure, take Paul's other courses.",
      "Pretty much does all the teaching for you. Textbook is a guideline but with him as your prof, you don't really need anything else. Overall great prof. Tricky course but his teaching style is fantastic.",
      "Clear and comprehensive speaker. His authority is immediately recognized in class. He explains everything to the smallest detail and maximizes the learning possibilities for his sTudents",
      "Came into the class with no background knowledge and he taught the course so clearly. Great prof.",
      "He is probably the best professor I will ever have. He has a very effective teaching style, crystal-clear screencasts, and good humour :) Also, love his accent! Very sad to find out that he only teaches first 8 weeks of this course :(",
      "hes nice",
      "A really good prof, really helpful. Listen to him every class because if you do not, you will be lost. He is very helpful too. He is just a great prof in general.",
      "It's really sad I prob will never have a prof as clear as him anymore. He is like &quot;this is what you need to know and here is how to do it&quot;. No unnecessary talks which saves tons time. He makes the course easy and programing fun. if you are looking for a fun entertaining prof he's not the option but a clear helpful prof he is the top choice.",
      "THe best prof i've had in first year engineering by a landslide and he's a comp sci teacher! I wish he taught every class",
      "Good prof overall.His lectures are easy to understand and his thoughts are clear to follow.Very patient. Great Prof =]",
      "Paul Carter is AWESOME. I wish every prof were like him. His teaching style is somewhat unique and works extremely well. Everyone I know loves him. He's a legend.",
      "Amazing screen casts. the best prof. i've ever came across!",
      "PAUL CARTER ROCKS MY WORLD. his 30 minute screencasts (watched at home) explain basics. in-class problems expose you to more advanced problems, prepare you for labs+exams. WARNING: clicker questions pretty much eliminate sleepers/skippers. (in 8 am classes, very important!) overall, apsc 160 was a very enjoyable course.",
      "Great teacher that really wants to help his students to do good in the class",
      "This guy knows how to teach. Probably one of the clearest instructors i've ever had. Everything is crystal clear, his explanations and examples are brilliant. Also he is available for help, to aid through the learning. I like this teacher",
      "Honestly, if every engineering class were taught the way Paul Carter taught APSC 160, then engineering would be so much easier. Honestly, UBC needs more professors like him.",
      "awesome teacher! makes me want to do comp sci.",
      "A rare find these days, a teacher that actually CARES about how the students are doing and about their learning. He is always available for help and is always willing to help you, he actually wants you to do well in the course, his method of teaching is somewhat unique where there are no lectures but it's extremely effective aposed to traditional.",
      "Carter's a cool Englishman who has great teaching techniques. His teaching style is special and it worked very well for me. His screen casts and work sheets were really helpful.",
      "He's got to be the best prof I've had all year. Gets the content across very well.",
      "A great Prof.",
      "Very helpful, makes things easy to understand. Only reason people would find him as rude is that he doesn't tolerate people talking while he's talking, which is a good thing. Best prof I've had so far.",
      "great prof. highly recommended.",
      "Excellent prof, one of my favourites in first year. The fact that I managed an A+ without any previous programming experience speaks volumes of how well of a job he does teaching the course material",
      "Paul Carter teaches the material for 211 in a very clear manner with plenty of supporting material referenced in the textbook and elsewhere. The class is highly Java-centric, which is a flaw IMHO, but not the fault of the professor. There were only four assignments and they were all easy; I would have appreciated more. I would recommend this prof.",
      "BEST computer science prof. Totally clear and knows his material so well. The only question is why can't all profs be like him&#63;!",
      "Great teacher.",
      "one of my Best profs in 1st year engineering",
      "Holy GOD this man can teach. He actually does examples and forces everyone to participate in working on them during lecture time. You won't hesitate for a second to ask him questions in class.",
      "Awesome professor. Very friendly and helpful if you ask him questions, and very knowledgeable. Fantastic!",
      "Marking was very tough and I didn't enjoy the lectures very much.",
      "Great instructor. My favourate instructor.",
      "Professional. The man commands respect. He knows what's he doing and know how to teach it. I've never programmed a thing before taking this class and I ended up with 90% in the end. Labs can be tricky. Notes are better than the text. If you're not in his class, transfer now. And yes, he's got a lovely accent. =)",
      "Truly a great prof. He is smart, organised, sincere, makes a strong effort in the class to maintain order and get a clear message across (even though the material is obscure). If you go to him for help - don't piss him off. Switch into his class at all cost though - he's that good. I knew no programming and I got 80 on the final.",
      "Great Prof, alot of examples and his teaching is very clear and easy. He tends to be quite helpful throughout the course and encourages questions and discussion in class.",
      "Very good instructor.",
      "good prof",
      "Awesome prof. Explains everything very well, labs are ridiculously easy, and even if you have no programming experience (like me) this is one of the easiest courses you will ever take, so long as you put the time in.",
      "I loved this class. The assignments were challenging and really stimulated me to think about the topics described in class.",
      "The best course I've taken in my two years here, and probably the best prof I'll ever have. I completely enjoyed going to class.",
      "Excellent prof. He explains concepts clearly and well, and is receptive to questions. I enjoyed his lecture style very much. And indeed, he has a lovely accent.",
      "This guy is fantastic. his lecture style is smooth and clear and he writes code on the board (by hand) and then goes over it. if i had just gone to this lecture in the beginning, i would still be enrolled in the comp sci program. instead i was in wolfman's lecture and now i am leaving. the disparity is really that big.",
      "Best first year prof that I have. All you have to do is print out his notes and make sure you PAY ATTENTION (and fill out the notes)! He's very helpful and has a lovely accent. Definitely one of the best prof's on campus.",
      "lovely accent",
      "best prof I've had at ubc so far. Very efficent when teaching. Has very good control of the class. Overall is well organized. definately recommend being in his class if you have a course that he teaches",
      "NOT GOOD",
      "Note: you don't have to worry about his &quot;easiness&quot; rating. Last year, both sections/profs had same labs, midterms, and final. So u don't have a choice",
      "Excellent professor. Explains concepts clearly and logically in a manner which everyone understands. Seems to be one of the few professors at UBC who excels at teaching.",
      "Paul puts together organized and clear notes, and is helpful outside and inside class. However, his nature is to begin each interaction as a confronation. Most questions that do not involve clarifying class material are met with a &quot;why should I let you do that&quot; kind of approach. This is not to say he unreasonable; he is reasonable and logical.",
      "Excellent teacher. Probably the best UBC prof ive ever had. Lectures are very clear, slides very organized. If you go ask him questions he'll always answer it. Exams are very fair; no tricks involved. If youve been following along in class and doing labs, its easy to pass with flying colours.",
      "My favourite first year prof",
      "Best Prof Ever.",
      "Dr. Carter is definitely one of the best teacher I've ever had. His lecturing skill is so good that the 12 diciples would have abandoned jesus and become computer scientists. I would pay twice the money to just get in his class. So happy to be his student that my tears are coming down as i rite this",
      "He is one of the best prof! =)",
      "great prof. gives useful advice during office hrs. uber flexible. i failed both midterms miserably and passed the course with an above class avg mark. totally couldn't have done it without his help and encouragement. thank you sooo much dr. carter!",
      "Paul is one of those teachers whos ability to simplify complex material makes this challenging course manageable. The course is jam pact with assignments, midterms and labs which are extremely time consuming. You will learn a ton and I highly recomend this teacher.",
      "he's the greatest prof i've ever seen! I have never had a teacher that explains things so well like him. Kind of sad that he only teaches us for the first part of the courses. Now I almost fall asleep in class with the second prof who teaches the second part of the course.",
      "Dr. Carter is so awesome! He totally goes over eveything in class until like EVERYONE gets it. He also posts the notes for everything he does in class on webCT so you dont have to waste time writing everything down. He is by far my best professor this year!",
      "I didn't know jack**** about java (or any other language) b4 going to his class. But he was crytal clear in his lectures and quite helpful (albeit a little intimidating at first), but I still wound up with an A =D",
      "You really need to know how to do the assignments or have someone teach you or else you're pretty much dead. It's like a language, you have to learn the language in order to achieve in this course. But the prof is really approachable and he tries to help.",
      "great prof! Knew my name the first time I went into his office!",
      "Good prof! although his assignments/exams are quite hard, just put some effort into them, you will get a good mark! :)",
      "No Comments",
      "Like what everyone said, Great Prof! But the course is just too demanding: assignments, labs, 2 midterms, and final. His assignments and exams aren't easy afterall.",
      "Dr.Carter's notes are very organized and helpful. He is a very nice guy and helps students as much as he can. However, his exams are not that easy. PS Projects are not easy too. He is still my favorite CS prof. Dr. CARTER is recommended.~~~~",
      "Great prof! Very clear, Very helpful!",
      "great prof and great instruction",
      "He's the best prof!!! He's engaging and very patient, if you have questions, just email him or ask after class, he's totally receptive.",
      "Very organized,anwers students' mail fairly quickly!He has this boyish charm which makes the class all the more fun!CPSC 111 is more fun because of him~He's doing ALMOST all the work for both sections so that's why it's recommand that you go for his class",
      "Extremely organized and understandable. He is by far the best CPSC prof I've ever had. I'll definitely take more courses with this prof. He makes everything so clear. If you don't understand his lecture, then something's wrong with you.",
      "Great prof (helpful and instructive), but unforunately cpsc 111 is hard not matter which prof u have.",
      "Very well organized. Understading.",
      "IMO, The best prof I have ever had in my 4 years of post secondary. Excellent teaching. VERY helpful.",

      "very nice and helpful",
      "Best teacher I've had so far. Exams and assignments were fair... He didn't come up with questions out of this world like other teachers sometimes do",

      "Awesome prof, disliked his worksheets near the end of the term tho. Don't buy a textbook you can easily find pdf online",
      "Tries to be funny a lot, and askes whether everything was understood.",
      "Very patient, makes lectures engaging and gives great feedback when he walks around in class.",
      "Iclicker for participation textbook is a must class is easier than 110 as long as you understand the basic logic",
      "Smart guy, he's been teaching this course for ages so he knows it inside out. Very willing to answer questions and he drops dry humor every now and then during lectures to keep everyone entertained. Make sure you go to the lectures as he explains some difficult concepts in the course very well",
      "Patrice is obviously very knowledgable on the topics taught in CPSC 121 but the lectures are quite slow paced and the course timeframe is way longer than it needs to be. He will give almost too much time for clicker questions or to think about problems. This course could easily be completed in 2-3 months. Lectures do help to clarify concepts though",
      "Patrice is absolutely the best. Especially if you're planning to take CPSC 121, TAKE IT WITH PATRICE. He's the only one that writes the exams/assignments, and while other profs have a hard time coming up with a circuit/DFA's, Patrice can do it all. Very helpful during office hours, he knows what he is doing.",
      "He is a good prof, I believe the best one for CPSC 121, but the class itslef is hard, the lectures are challenging, a lot of reading, and the grading scheme is not to clear most times.",
      "Really hilarious, the man has a true passion for teaching low-level CPSC courses and it shows. The lectures themselves are only slightly helpful, most of the stuff is in the textbook. What kept me attending was Patrice's great personality, wit, and caring for my learning. Take this course with Patrice and you won't regret it.",
      "320 is always a hard course, but those tricky points are explained very clearly by Patrice. So glad to take another class with him after 121!!",
      "Prof is excellent at condensing the course material to the important subjects. The course is tough, but take advantage of Patrice and you'll get a B+ or higher. Textbook is actually really helpful, so do the reading. Study for the midterms/final, because while they are fair, they are still pretty tough. Participation goes a long way in his lectures",
      "Probably one of the best profs I've had so far given that science seems to have slim pickings. I can barely stand 1 1/2 hour lectures but his engaging way of teaching keeps me alert the entire time. Gotta give special props to his dad jokes. Honestly, I wish he'd teach more classes in the compsci department.",
      "He is a better comedian than he is a professor. And that is compliment for his teaching ability.",
      "His lectures can be very confusing but overall, he is a smart guy and takes his time answering everyone's questions.",
      "While the class is quite difficult, Patrice does his best to teach the subject matter. Each lecture has many examples and participation questions that should help you grasp everything, as long as you show up and do the reading.",
      "Good prof, really cares about his students.",
      "I took 121 in my 4th year so I've had a lot of experience with other profs. He is really good at teaching and boils down concepts to the basics without any fluff. The course itself is hard if you haven't had experience with circuits/discrete math, so it helps that he knows what he's doing.",
      "One of the nicest profs ever! And he's quite funny. Patrice is extremely helpful during office hours, and he's patient with his students when they come to him for questions. We had 4 tests (instead of a midterm), each one was challenging but fair. The final though was incredibly difficult.",
      "Amidst all of our other monotonous lectures, my friends and I always looked forward to getting to sit down and listen to Patrice make Dad-jokes for an hour. He is a funny guy and an excellent instructor. This course can be challenging in first year, but if you have some previous knowledge in symbolic logic and math, it is an easy A with Patrice.",
      "Amazing prof, definitely knows how to teach. Compared to the other CPSC profs, I've had, he's easily one who can teach the material in such a way that attending lectures and doing the assignments will get you a decent grade. Textbook is not needed unless you want an A and really learn in-depth, but his lectures are clear enough by themselves.",
      "Patrice is an amazing instructor - lectures are clear, helpful, and hilarious! He's super approachable and really knows how to teach this course well. This course is not so easy when you take it with him but it's worth it! DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PATRICE.",
      "One of the most amazing professor in cs.",
      "Patrice is a senior instructor for the department for a reason. He explains things very well and inspires a lot of interest in students. Though exams are tough, go to class, go to office hours when needed, and you'll be fine!",
      "Amazing Prof. His lectures can seem like a lot to take in but all his notes are posted online and he explains things really clearly in office hours. Definitely a great prof for this difficult course.",
      "Lecture notes are well organized and has plenty of practice. Does not publish lecture notes so you have to show up to class. Take advantage of the TA hours if you don't understand what's being taught. He's extremely smart. Assignments take ~5 hours to do.",
      "very boring lectures and awkward jokes; good marker; must attend the computer registers part of lectures to understand them",
      "easy to understand lectures and helpful office hours.",
      "Patrice is an amazing professor. I found 313 to be much easier than 213 cause of him. His tests can be hard but they are do-able. Makes himself very accessible and is crystal clear during office hours.",
      "Taught the material fairly effectively, although sometimes had strange ways of explaining things. Exams were alright. On the final he said he would not have specific machine language instructions, but he ended up including them. Make sure to put them on your formula sheet.",
      "Patrice is a fantastic teacher. He is funny and super smart. The material is not easy but he presents it clearly and his door is always open if you need help. Classes are coherent and well structured.",
      "Labs are a nightmare if you aren't used to that sort of thing. Just make sure you know the labs, because they will be examed.",
      "Very knowledgeable, and willing to help you with almost every problem you encounter. Tests were extremely similar to practice ones. His accent was troublesome at times, but he does not mind if you ask him to repeat. Take this course with him for a GPA boost!",
      "Honestly, he's THE ONLY PROFESSOR that can teach Cpsc 320 properly. I took 320 with Steve Wolfman last year and I was completely destroyed. Utterly annihilated. I learned NOTHING in Wolfman's class so walking into Patrice's class with an empty brain, I feel he can at least concisely explain concepts. He's super smart too and has plenty of examples.",
      "Very accessible and helpful. His lectures, for the most part, are pretty organized and the notes are clean and readable. He was also very clear on what topics were being tested on the final. However, his exams are notoriously difficult!",
      "Excellent prof! The course material is tough, but his lectures make it interesting. His jokes are actually funny though occasionally really un-PC.",
      "Great prof for theory. Very clear and helpful. The courses he teaches are always hard theory ones, but I I find that he marks quite generously and is always willing to give part marks for solutions that are close.",
      "Has a great sense of humour and teaches with enthusiasm, which motivates students to pay even more attention during lectures. Is also very experienced and knowledgeable regarding topics covered; always readily helpful.",
      "This course is challenging and fun, even for a student with some familiarity with CS. Dr. Belleville is very clear, and the labs and assignments were just about right. There were four quizzes, which were extremely helpful for figuring out what to study. If you're genuinely interested in a formal CS education (and not code monkey), take this course!",
      "Great professor who effectively leads the class through some very difficult concepts. His lectures are bulletproof and obviously well thought-out and perfected over the years... good job!",
      "Very high expectations for assignments, expect to spend way too much time on them, but always available to help you out. Tests are much easier than assignments and almost exactly like the practise exam he gives. He explains material well in class.",
      "Interesting prof, course content is fairly difficult, especially if you've never had experience with proofs before. Labs are an absolute nightmare at first if this is new stuff to you. Prof is clear and has a sense of humour all his own. Midterm was brutal, but the final was relatively easy. Still, a challenging course overall.",
      "I don't know how I've done CPSC 121 without him and the TA's. He's well prepared and funny. I don't really have much to say about him. Just take him for any courses!! But the course isn't easy.",
      "Teaches material in a manner that is much too formal (notation, etc). Too much memorizing as opposed to designing your own algorithms. Very well prepared, explains things well. Always monitors newsgroup / email, replies quickly. I just wish he didn't require us to be so formal in proofs, etc.",
      "Nice guy, dedicated as an instructor, and funny. Lectures were fun. The course is very hard though, and the midterm was a killer.",
      "Was well organized and clear and answered questions in class, but was not very helpful or considerate during office hours.",
      "Without a doubt the best teacher i Have had at UBC. He has tons of interest in his courses and is very helpfull, he is always willing to take your questions during class or help you during his office hours. Note:this is a hard class (121) so don't take it if you just want to coast through, it won't work, there are weekly assignments.",
      "One of the most difficult courses in the computer science field. Its one of those courses that you think are so difficult and as a result you end up working harder than normal and getting a decent grade. Just dont think this is easy. Belleville takes a hard course and describes a lot of the material in clarity. Good prof.",
      "No Comments",
      "professional,talkative, and wordy. a nice guy.",
      "No Comments",
      "He's the best prof! He's extremely nice and friendly and he tries his very best to help his students. He's considerate of his students and he's constantly trying to do better and considering student's feedback. He's so dedicated that he answers post on the bullentin board every couple hours every day! He's great guy, great prof! Patrice, u rock!!",
      "a nice instructor with a great understanding of students. usual perception is that he lets most of the students pass. if you work good he will let you pass. assignments are ok not too bad but still math is math,",
      "Patrice is probably the smartest overall CS prof at UBC. He'll go out of his way to help students and to make himself available in person, via newsgroup, etc. His lectures are easy to follow and understand, even if the material is tough. I would have been totally lost in cs320 with any other prof.",
      "Extremely good at explaining difficult concepts. He makes himself available if you need extra help, and he always checks and replies to the newsgroup.",
      "He's friendly and responsible. He most likely replies to questions from the newsgroup immediately. He designed the CPSC 121 course indeed. He's really good.",
      "Very intelligent and smart man... might want to move from using a chalkboard to using slides one of these days... powerpoint maybe even... considering CS. This is they guy who takes that hardest courses in CS and does whatever it takes to get it into the minds of his students. A+++",
      "UBC has an asset in Pat.",
      "i love patrice. if i was a female nerd, i would marry him.",
      "patrice is the nicest man alive! he answers emails at odd hours during the day and night and answers questions thoroughly during and after class. although his presentation style is lacking, he does try to make little jokes and speaks/writes very clearly.",
      "Patrice is fantastic. I would definetly go out of my way to get into another one of his sections in the future.",
      "Good prof, good course. One of the few courses I enjoyed, and one of the rare courses where I found it very useful to take notes and attend all classes.",
      "No Comments",
      "The course itself was very hard but he did an amazing job making people understand the material. Very helpful and considerate. Very good prof but too bad the course material is pretty difficult....",
      "While the course that he teaches is very difficult, I think with the material he had, he did really well and explained everything clear enough so that everyone was able to understand (I was anyway). His notes are very detailed and accurate.",
      "should get a 10/5 for helpfulness, in and out of the classroom",
      "Very enjoyable prof that gives good notes, whether it be online or chalk. Isn't necessarily his fault that he's always teaching the hardest courses- in fact that must be a testament to his skill ;)",
      "What an awesome prof. Top 3 at UBC. Explains hard topics very well and answers any questions you might have. Checks newsgroups/email 24/7 too. Can't ask for much more than that.",
      "He is the most helpful professor I've ever met. He's even helpful for things not related to the course. The course is hard, so it's better to take it with such a helpful prof.",
      "Excellent prof! You will do well in his class if you put enough effort into it. 320 is hard, but I did well because I put A LOT of effort into it. Patrice is extremely helpful and answered my emails + questions on the newsgroup even at 1am !!!! EXCE",
      "Consider yourself lucky if you get Patrice!!! Way to go - deserves the teaching awards!!!",
      "very nice and helpful guy... at almost 2am, he still answered my email!! a bit hard, but he explains things pretty good... and yes, you've got to love the comb-over. =)",
      "He's got the sexiest comb-over. HOT like FIRE!",
      "Extremely helpful. Reasonable exams. Challenging assignments let you understand more of the course material :) Clear notes. Highly recommanded!",
      "Patrice is an excellent teacher.",
      "patrice is &quot;the&quot; guy to go to for any problems related to cs... very very helpful and knowledgable... replies your posts on newsgroup (or e-mails) ASAP...",
      "Very nice and helpful.",
      "Good proff, has a lot of consideration for students. Will email you back within ten minutes, even at 1am at night. Pretty hard with exams and sometimes assumes too much of student intelligence when doing lectures.",
      "His classes aren't that easy but he's very helpful. Answers emails very quickly.",
      "had him for 126,219,320. works extremely hard and is a very good guy. honest, caring... very fair tests and assignments. they do require some thought so 90% is much harder in his class than most, but you won't be hard pressed to pass.",
      "great prof... learned a lot. really good about being available for students questions... very considerate... exams are kinda long, but otherwise fair."

      "Fun class. I know some people found the flipped-classroom structure and funny problem-based exams polarizing, but I loved them! Lecture-activities are super helpful for understanding concepts -- they make sure you're thinking, not just copying stuff down. Exams all about whether you learned the stuff, not whether you memorized.",
      "Steve is an excellent prof. His lectures are interesting and his midterms are an opportunity to learn (but you MUST do the practice midterms to pass). This course could benefit from more in-class activities, and a better textbook. The material itself is difficulty, as is the grading criteria, but Steve does his best to teach it well.",
      "One of the best profs at cs department. Be prepared before you go to lecture, otherwise, it is really hard to follow his pace.",
      "I was surprised at all these negative reviews - tbh he's one of the best profs I've ever had, and seemed genuinely very kind, entertaining, and patient. His lectures were pretty good too. I thought he was amazing, but maybe he teaches the difficult courses differently.",
      "The most enthusiastic prof I've ever had. Really articulate, and shows he cares about the subject matter and the excitement makes you appreciate the material more.",
      "sacrificed clickers just to attend his class 10/10",
      "Steve is an amazing professor, the classes are very unusual (more thinking than listening) which is a very good way of learning. With Steve, this class is not only about programming but more generally about how to approach problems: I can only recommend you to take it. You should go to class to get the most out of it.",
      "Very energetic and amazing! Does what has to be done real quick and leaves the rest of the times for students to solve the problems themselves. In a sense he doesn't really lecture! So if you expect a prof that does the thinking for you and tell you every answer Wolfman is not your guy! Also you have to do pre-readings for every class or you fail!",
      "His lectures are probably the highlight of this course. Be prepared: the course has an ASTRONOMICAL workload (10 hours a week at least). Between the problem sets, the practice problems, the videos, labs and studying for the tests, you'll be completely screwed if you fall behind. It is not impossible; with LOTS of practice, you can do very well.",
      "Steve is an awesome prof. Clear lectures, nice guy, whatever. CPSC 110 however, is a pretty stupid course.",
      "Definitely a great prof and would recommend to anyone taking 110",
      "Steve is an amazing professor. I loved his classes. He is undoubtedly a great teacher. Of course there's the part about him being funny but also the fact that he explains everything in a lot of detail that really helped me grasp concepts faster. I'd definitely recommend his class to any of my friends!",
      "The best prof I've ever had. Really got me interested in algorithms. Was hilarious and made the courses a lot of fun. The problems were fun to solve and the class moved at a comfortable pace. Makes the courses quite involved and interesting. I plan to take as many classes with him as possible. Also took CPSC 320 with him.",
      "Steven is such a funny guy He always has some jokes during lectures, but sometimes he just goes too fast... No textbook but videos! I have to say that the exams are hard if you do not keep up with the material and get enough practice. It's really IMPORTANT to stay with him! Really like him",
      "He is a excellent prof and the best prof I have seen in UBC. He taught you the method and understanding instead of just knowledge.",
      "Hands down the best professor and best class I've ever taken. His exams are difficult, but pay attention and you'll learn a ton! He makes it look too easy. Practice lots of problems.",
      "I had three classes with Steve. They were all great, he is a great lecturer. Make sure you don't skip any of his classes and you'll be fine. (his exams can be tough, but they are usually very similar to the practice exams)",
      "Steve is funny and very approachable, and his lectures are interesting and fun. He comes very prepared to every class, and he would would often go over time on his office hoursafter class to make sure students understood the concepts. I recommend (for 311) doing the readings ahead of time because he moves quickly over course topics. Amazing prof!",
      "The classes were an intense 50 minutes of learning, so make sure to keep your focus. Although he generally follows the textbook, he emphasizes the most important parts making the lectures worthwhile. Entertaining as well as very educational. Very fast feedback.",
      "Definitely cares about teaching; he puts into practice all the current theory on engaging teaching. If you actively engage yourself in his class, and actually try to enjoy the learning, you will get swept up in it. The only really really difficult part of the class is induction (unless you are an honour math student...). Definitely recommend.",
      "Steve is a funny, kind, and nice guy. He's a great prof. Textbook is completely unneeded and attendance isn't necessary\u2014the best way to master this material is through youtube videos. If Steve really wanted to make his lectures useful, he'd get a bunch of paper cups with numbers on them for algorithm demonstrations. Too much emphasis on proofs.",
      "Amazing prof, very enthusiastic and helpful. Got me interested in both the theoretical and hardware sides of computing.",
      "Very excellent professor. Don't be deceived by other comments! At first, I though he was pandering to us, but then I realized he just really cares about the students and materials. Excellent professor. Very clear and knowledgable. One of my favorites.",
      "Fantastic prof!",
      "You have to work in this course but he gives you more than enough to go on. He seems to really care about his students!! But why would any prof want to help slackers?!",
      "One of my favourite profs (I was in his 121 class as well). 121 was definitely easier than 221 just because of the material and the expectations of the students, but this prof was great for both. Very helpful and entertaining, and obviously wants the best for his students.",
      "I failed miserably his course at the beginning of the course but I end up passed. His exams wasn't easy, and the course required a lot of reading, understanding and determination. He's more that gladly to help you when you ask. Just don't be shy. (side note: this is 2011 sept course)",
      "Really depends on one's style of learning. Very enthusiastic and helpful, but really have to keep up or you're left with a pile of disorganized pdf notes and a useless textbook. Recommended prof if you really pay attention during lectures and genuinely interested in the topic.",
      "Very funny teacher, very helpful. Assignments can be a little bit challenging, but you can work in pairs. I would definitely take another his course.",
      "This prof will whip you hard, but after you come out of it all, you will have become a better man (and programmer).",
      "Very good professor who is teaching a very complicated course. Got a good grade at the end, but not without a lot of hard work, and a lot of low grades inbetween as well. Very caring, and always available to help",
      "Natural teacher. Very good explanations. Motivates students to learn. Registered in another section but went to his. Very helpful outside class. This guy was hired to teach, not research.",
      "Writing code is his method of lecturing, so if you're used to copying notes from the whiteboard, prepare for a major shift in learning style. Read the textbook before doing the assignments. Midterms were &quot;optional&quot; and graded such that it won't penalize your final grade if you do bad. Very helpful during office hours.",
      "Very helpful and tries to be clear. Extremely enthusiastic and may be oblivious to the fact that you're not. Cares personally about students and tries to know everyone's name. However, he's known to some as &quot;Darth Wolfman&quot; for his difficult exams.",
      "Great instructor! As others have noticed, very hard midterms and assignments, but encourages discussion and always willing to help. Finals are more than fair to make up. You will know your sh*t well after his classes. Also he brings treats to class! Lecture notes are not stand alone, you must attend class. He just gets the harder courses to teach.",
      "I took CPSC 320 with Wolfman and to be honest I failed it, along with several classmates I know. However Wolfman himself is not a terrible professor, he's extremely intelligent and engaging, and will spend time to explain things. My biggest mistake is not utilizing his OH more. He's a great guy, he's just teaching very very VEEERRYYY hard courses.",
      "Extremely difficult class, probably the hardest in CPSC program. That being said Steve gives really hard assignments and even harder midterms (if you pass you are doing awesome!!), however if you put in the time to see him in his office hour you will get 100% on his assignments and understand the course material alot better.",
      "very enthusiastic.....interesting lectures.lots of assignments(very very hard but interesting! labs were not easy. mts were VERY HARD and LONG! final was very fair tho. not only need to understand the material but think deeply. my favorite prof so far!",
      "Really enthusiastic about the material and loves teaching it. Very interactive classes, with lots of discussion amongst ourselves. In class problems and exams required good thought, so if you don't think too well don't take him.",
      "I was so worried because I got 60's on the midterm.. but in the end I got A+! I like this prof. He is very nice.",
      "The material and exams were very challenging, but Steve was always available for answering questions, and answered questions on the discussion board daily. Steve is enthusiastic and makes students a high priority.",
      "-if you want a challenge",
      "Pretty good prof, a little bit too enthusiastic sometimes (esp when it comes to his daughter...). Assignments are very easy (and relevant) but midterms/finals are REALLY hard. The course is very challenging but he made it bearable.",
      "most engaging prof i've had so far in any class (including arts classes which tend to be more fun in lecture). He is always enthusiastic about answering students' questions and really knows what he's talking about. I expected this class to be really dry but with Steve lecturing, i was very wrong.",
      "He knows his stuff and loves it too. For those interested in computer science, he is a perfect match because he neither irrelevant nor dull in the least. I chalk my general dislike of the class to my inability to connect with the subject matter. If he taught anything outside computer science, I'd sign up for that class in a heartbeat.",
      "Give me a break, you don't get 4 science credits for nothing. This guy really know what he's talking about, and his enthusiasm shows that he really cares about what he is teaching, one of the best prof!",
      "Steve is extremely helpful and excited about what he does. You get the feeling that he actually cares about his students' education. You do have to keep up on your readings because he doesn't spoonfeed the material to you powerpoint lecture style, he teaches you how to apply the concepts by writing code and explaining what he's doing as he goes.",
      "He teaches very clearly, usually coding relative programs during the class. I've learn a lot of thing about concept of OOP!!",
      "This is BEST prof ever, IMO. He is extremely engaging and always helpful. Kudos to Steve! Textbook used was computatinal intelligence SECOND edition - the unreleased version. It's not finished yet so we were given access to the draft for free.",
      "He may have caused us to fall behind, however, I like how he demonstrates the concepts by typing code instead of using slides. He's extremely helpful, so take full advantage of his office hours! He's also got me so much more interested in computer science that I might consider doing a minor or even a combined major.",
      "A great prof who explanis things very well. He is extremely interested in the material he teaches, and can impart this impart this interest to his students. He made this class a lot of fun.",
      "Steve is one of the best instructors I've ever had! Enthusiatic about the subject AND about teaching. Never have I had a more prepared instructor who is so committed to teaching and learning.",
      "Steve is one of the best professors I've ever had: he's extremely engaging, his assignments are tough but fair, and he makes even the driest material interesting. He'll make you work hard, but you'll learn a lot. Plus it's hard to beat a prof who buys everyone pizza after the midterm and sings for us (in costume, no less) after the final.",
      "one of the best prof. CS311 is hard. it's interpreter construction. and you have to be well prepared for 411, compilor construction. but steve is already making the course easier to understand and fun, insteresting, clear, etc. try take this course with another prof, see what you can learn and get, and u'll know steve is good.",
      "Insanely difficult labs: between 25 and 50 hours to complete a 2 week lab. In addition to labs, assignments took 5 - 10 hours with one assignment per week.",
      "Steve is an awesome professor! He is funny, helpful and clear. Personally (unlike most people in my class) I also enjoyed his midterm and final. They were sort of tricky, but still doable if you are fairly good at the subject. (and personally I like a challenge now and then)",
      "I've never had a professor who cared this much about his students. You can email him at midnight and expect a reply within 10min. He works hard, and he expects you to as well. Expect to have fun, but your average may suffer. He is hard. Did I mention that already&#63; HARD. You've been warned.",
      "Simply, one of the best proffs I've ever had. He probably spends 12 hours a day (or more!) preparing material for his lectures and answering students' questions. He turned one of the most boring cs classes (cs312) to one of the most exciting classes I've ever taken in UBC But be forwarned... Steve will make you WORK HARD... VERY VERY VERY H",
      "He is the best prof I have ever had. Although the class was about a few relatively obscure languages, he made it really interesting. I learned a lot about learning languages!",
      "Steve is a very helpful prof. He really cares about the students, and will help you FOR SURE if you ask for help. For the last day of class, he dressed up as a Panda. It was hilarious!",
      "Probably the best prof I've ever had, really makes an effort to get everyone involved with the class and he must spend hours and hours posting helpful messages on WebCT. Brought cookies as a consolation for our midterm. 312 is worth taking, Steve will make it interesting.",
      "Best prof, ever. He actually cares about what he's doing and the enthusiasm comes through clearly.",
      "Great teacher. Explains things clearly, and is always very receptive to students' questions. Very helpful outside of class time.",
      "intellengent, helpful, and very nice..^^",
      "Steve makes logic and functional programming really accessible - he is V. engaging and CLEAR. Also he has a really good pace.",
      "Awesome! Very excited about teaching, takes huge pains to make the material and himself accessible to students.",
      "No Comments",
      "Very helpful, but exams can be very challenging.",
      "Agreed with above comment.",
      "No Comments",
      "The most helpful professor that I know of. He helps students 24, 7. The pace of the course is faster than regular courses but that is what everyone wants, right&#63; I did because I wanted to learn more and more."

      "Strict but amazing prof. Comp sci is hard but he does his best to teach his students. I took the online section but I met him in person as well because he was interested in feedback to improve the course. Tbh all the CPSC110 profs are great, you can't miss.",
      "Gregor is the most amazing prof i've ever had! So inspiring and motivating. He truly cares about his students and does everything he possibly can to help them do well in his course. He is super aware of the difficulty of this course's content and never makes his students feel dumb or that they aren't capable of doing well. Overall amazing person",
      "If you didnt choose Gregor as your CPSC 110 prof, what are you doing with your life? Best prof hands down. Teaches amazingly well, encourages students, cares for students, and teaches amazingly well. This was my first time learning programming, and I really enjoyed it. Trust the Natural Recursion. - the new motto of my life.",
      "CPSC 110 is a beginner-friendly course, but is very fast-paced. You MUST keep up with the video lectures and problem sets. If you fall behind, you will be in trouble. If you keep up, this course is straight-forward and its really easy to do well. Gregor's video lectures explain concepts very well and he is very helpful on the discussion forums.",
      "Gregor is hilarious and teaches the material very well and reinforces them by giving clicker quizzes at the start of every lecture. The overall course isn't very challenging but that is only if you keep up with the video lectures and practice problems. He is also hilarious and inspiring, highly recommend.",
      "Gregor makes this tough course slightly easier, as his lectures are very straightforward and understandable. He sometimes assumes that his students know more than they actually do, based on a couple of questions asked by the same few keepers in the crowd. Make sure you keep up with the homework, especially if you have no prior experience.",
      "Possibly the most intelligent man I've ever been taught by, but he doesn't make you feel dumb. If anything, he teaches the course in a way that makes you feel accomplished in what is being taught. The course is quite (nee very) difficult, but keeping up with EdgeX videos and attending lectures will keep your head above water. Inspiring prof.",
      "Gregor is one of the best prof I met in UBC. He might look serious but he is super approachable and patient outside class. I am not in his section but I sometimes go to his office hours. He explains everything in a super clear efficient and encouraging way. 110 is a hard course but Gregor and his videos make everything better.",
      "Gregor doesn't baby his students, but if you keep up with the material and stay present during lecture, you stand to gain a lot from his courses. I've seen students complain that the systematic design patterns are too rigid, but I think that they've missed the point of the material: to avoid reinventing the wheel and focus on interesting problems.",
      "Incredibly inspiring and knowledgeable prof. If you put the work in, you will learn so much. The material is easy, there's just a loooot of it.",
      "great prof, he knows his stuff, great at teaching the concepts, you just need to be ready to learn and want to learn, the concepts are hard and challenging but the class is fun and they always try to help your grade go up, trust me.",
      "He is good. Just a bit too mechanical in they way he goes about his things. Make sure you do the pre-lecture stuff or you will not get a word he teaches in lecture.",
      "very nice and caring.",
      "I loved CPSC 110 and I found Gregor to be an amazing prof. He is understanding of the difficulty of the course and he is an amazing lecturer. He has an amazing understanding of the course material and he always puts in the effort to make the class feel more personal despite the large size (300+).",
      "CPSC110 was my favorite course of the term. It was well thought out, and the prof motivated me to work hard throughout.",
      "Gregor is an amazing prof, one of the best I've had in my two years at UBC. He really cares about the learning of his students and stops often in lecture to field questions, answering them thoroughly. This class has an insane workload, but that being said, if you're willing to work hard it's very possible to get a great mark.",
      "Great course and great professor!He cares about what he is teaching, and we wrote some great programs during this course.",
      "This course only becomes difficult if you fall behind - this course has a huge workload! - otherwise the material is rather straightforward and relatively easy to grasp. With that said, Gregor knows this course inside and out, is extremely knowledgable, and really cares that students learn both effectively and efficiently. Great prof!",
      "Gregor is a god level prof and should be treated as such. His lectures are fun and packed with information. He makes you work for this course, and youre gonna have to spend time on it, but if you trust the natural recursion all will be well.",
      "Great prof, pretty much people who do well rate high and people who fail rate low. Watch your videos and practice because you will fail if you dont. The difficulty of the course is irrelevant to Gregor as a professor, and you need to spend time or else you will not do well.",
      "Very intense course. Be prepared to devote a few hours a night to the material if you want to do well.",
      "If you trust the natural recursion you will ace this class",
      "Especially if you haven't programmed before, you need to be 100% on top of the homework and reading/video material. Start on assignments early. The lectures fill in the gaps with concrete examples and walk-throughs and Gregor is tough but fair. Exams were pretty reasonable.",
      "As long as you keep up with the videos and do your practice, his teaching really drives you to learn",
      "best prof ever... hard and time consuming course but definitely worth it",
      "Gregor is a professor who clearly knows every inch of the content that he teaches, and will answer questions clearly and concisely. He strives to get his students to succeed; he even stated once that \"There is about $300000 worth of tuition in this room and I'm gonna make every penny count.\" Be warned: ton of work is involved in his courses.",
      "He is a great lecturer. His classes were very interesting. However he is arrogant and rude. I would give him a perfect 5 if it wasn't for his rudeness.",
      "confused about the earlier commentators.. he's a great, funny, and engaging prof! enjoy while you can!",
      "Clear teacher, very interesting lessons. I would say he is a good prof but there is A LOT of work involved with the course.",
      "Really good prof. Lectures were engaging and interesting, and I learned new thing every class. The course was a lot of work and sometimes he answered too many stupid questions from people.",
      "Dr. Kiczales is the one who designed the entire course (CPSC 110) so he knows the material extremely well and answers student questions with 100% clarity. Attend lectures as he gives good problems to try. Watching the videos is a must as you will be lost if you don't. Expect to put in more time at the beginning of term if you have never programmed.",
      "Prof. Kiczales teaches the ideas universally used in CS. Some topics are harder to grasp and you may end up spending more time on homework than you'd expected. However, the online lectures and plenty of TA hours are there to help. Just open your mind & expect mood swings from \"HAHA, I'm a mighty god!!\" to \"Never will touch programming again!!!\"",
      "Absolutely incredible professor who distills a challenging subject matter into very clear expectations. At times, I thought he focused too heavily on some of the really obnoxious/ridiculous/unprepared student questions in lecture. The tests weren't very fair in that the marking was very, very nitpicky.",
      "Very enthusiastic and fun! Be careful about raising your hand when he polls the class, cause he encourages participation and might call on you!",
      "GO TO LECTURES! Skipping a month worth of lectures was the biggest mistake I've ever made in uni, 1) because I didn't learn the material properly and 2) because Gregor is actually an AMAZING prof. He is HILARIOUS & knowledgable, but make sure to know your stuff because he walks around and checks on your progress, lol. And yeah, expect a LOT of work",
      "I understand why some may be discouraged by Gregor's style, but I can guarantee that in all my years at UBC I haven't met another prof who knew their teaching material as well as Gregor did his. Pay attention and ask questions - He will find the way to help. Also, if you mistake his personality for malice, you probably need to lighten up a bit.",
      "I absolutely love Gregor's personality and teaching methodologies. I think this course was the best way for me to be introduced to programming, and it really boosted my confidence in my own abilities to code. He thinks so far ahead and really understands what is best for the students. But don't expect it to be easy, pay attention to lectures.",
      "I'm pretty sure the negative responses to Gregor were before my time. Easy A, super helpful, nothing could be negative",
      "I found 110 to be a great intro class; yes, you will use Racket which is not a widely used language, but the purpose of it is to help you learn computer scienceprogramming concepts. Be prepared to put a lot of time into this course if you want to do well. Gregor is a great teacher and is very helpful in his office hours.",
      "Coursera videos are really detailed and helpful for learning the concepts. The final exam was much harder than the midterms.",
      "The concept of this course is helpful for students new to programming, though still tough for rookies and requires tremendous time investment. The progress is slow for experienced programmers. More emphasis during the course is on format, readability rather than functionality. Recommended if you have time, interest, and requires a introduction.",
      "The course itself is terrible frankly put (at least for someone who has done significant programming prior). Objectively, however, Kiczales is a decent professor. He teaches well, but has little respect for students (understandable since most students in this intro course don't respect his field), and very clearly has favourite students.",
      "Great prof/personality",
      "Everyone here is complaining how the course was ridiculous and unclear. Although the course was VERY time consuming and stressful at times, Gregor did well at explaining and the in-class problems helped a lot. If you paid attention to the problems he was doing in class, it's easy. Videos were very helpful but needs better explanation in lectures.",
      "I feel that this course has been made too difficult to be considered a \"beginner\" 4 credit course. The videos we watch online are easy to understand, however if you have a heavy-ish course load... DON'T TAKE CPSC110. Spare yourself from that. This course requires ~15hours of DEDICATED TIME PER WEEK. If cpsc110 is req, then take it. OTHERWISE DON'T!",
      "I hated computer science before this class. I took it years back and failed and now I have to come back to it. He lighted up the interest again. Exams are hard .. ish but if you have really done your exercises, you will at least get a B-. I missed many assignments but still managed well. Overall a fun experience.",
      "As others have said, this course is fast-paced and VERY time-consuming. I took this course just for fun and kinda regret it.",
      "One of my favourite profs so far, he's very clear about what he expects of his students and his teaching is very clear. Attend lecture, do practice problems, watch the videos, etc. and it'll be an easy A/B.",
      "I came into the class with a fair bit of programming knowledge, and I found it quite easy. At first I didn't like his teaching style too much, but at some point I think the 'template' system pays off, at least in complicated programs. It seems like he was very involved in the creation of the curriculum, and he's certainly very knowledgeable.",
      "BEST PROF. EASY TO UNDERSTAND. NO NEED TO READ TEXTBOOKS AT ALL. EASY EXAMS.",
      "READ THIS CAREFULLY...Gregor is an amzing prof and he designed the whole intro to CPSC course so, you couldn't get better BUT (and read this carefully) watch and read everything 'pre-lecture', do every single weekly practice problem,and GO TO THE LABS. I slacked off early and fell behind quick. He designed the sylabus, all you have to is follow it!",
      "Heres the thing with cpsc, you MUST go to lectures and DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS!! If you do that, then this course is actually very easy. However, if you don't , you might actually fail. I got a B+ in this course, and i am in Arts. This prof is by far the best prof I have ever met. If you really want to learn com sci, take him.",
      "Very passionate and clear professor who really cares about his students. I had fun in class even though originaly I took it as a science requirement. Very much recomended.",
      "Awesome prof but you really have to pay attention and ask any doubts you have in class! He legit cares about the class doing well, lectures are detailed, but can be a bit fast paced. If you go to DLC hours and office hours, you should be good to go.",
      "Great careful professor. Knows his stuff well and very willing to help. Super clear in the concept he teaches. Very passionate about CPSC.",
      "Gregor was the best professor. 110 was my trial course to see if I wanted to go into computer science. He invented the course. Had I not had gregor and this fantastic course I might not feel the same. He expects you to work, but he is very fair in how the course is marked. I would take this with Gregor for anyone considering cpsc as a degree.",
      "The course isn't easy. The expectations and effort you need to put in are outlined explicitly. If you do it- you will do fine. Gregor is simply amazing. He puts in so much effot into this course and explain things in a clear manner. He is a truly caring and dedicated prof. I'd take 110 again just to have him as a prof.",
      "A great prof with very clear and intuitive exposition of the material. Absolutely perfect for an intro to compsci course.",
      "Great prof and great class. unlike a previous commenter, I am an arts student with no experience and got an 80 in the class. very fair marking and really interesting and helpful. Highly recommended if you're interested.",
      "Incredible Prof. ATTEND HIS LECTURES. The course itself isn't easy, but with his clarity and his ability to explain EVERYTHING, he makes the class worth it! Genuinely interesting and my favorite prof so far...",
      "Really good prof! His lectures are clear and well organized. The course itself isn't a free ride, it's work, but if you stay on top of the problem sets its super rewarding! I bet the people who didn't like him fell behind and discouraged themsleves: nothing wrong with Gregor himself.",
      "EXCELLENT prof!! His lectures are well-organized and engaging and he is very helpful during office hours.",
      "AMAZING PROF!! Go see him during office hours, he is so wonderfully helpful and always willing to help students and offer words of encouragement. He is one of the best at UBC.",
      "Never had a problem understanding what has been in the lectures has been a great experience so far.",
      "Great Teacher, best teacher I've had so far at UBC. Extremely helpful, he knows your name and wants you to succeed.",
      "Very enthusiastic teacher who calls upon students in class by name. Expects a lot of work on class projects, but his tests are fair. His first lecture may be scary, but it's worth staying in the class.",
      "Very passionate when teaching, he's a pretty good prof. that makes class interesting",
      "Awesome prof who really cares about the well-being of his students."

      "Man I absolutely love George, one of my fav profs at ubc, even though i'm now in my fourth year. The guy is a fantastic teacher and genuinely cares if the students are with him, he uses clickers very effectively, going over topics until people understand them. An absolute gem, in the CPSC department, a god among men.",
      "good guy george",
      "Great professor who cares about his students. He is also very friendly and extremely hilarious. Assignments and exams are fair if you put the effort in.",
      "A great professor who really cares about his students. Engaging and informative lectures, and absolutely hilarious. Also very fair exams and workload.",
      "He's a great prof. Everyone loved him in our class. He's amusing and enthusiastic, I liked listening to his lectures. His accent is thick, and it was difficult to understand for the first two classes, but afterwards it wasn't a problem at all. I would definitely recommend him, he's a caring prof who's passionate about his subject.",
      "Great professor, will definitely be looking to take a class with him again. Lectures were always fun and informative. Don't listen to all the people saying they couldn't understand him, he is more then easy to understand. If you are fluent in English you will not have a problem.",
      "Needs a while to get used to his accent.",
      "No one can explain a concept as clearly as George. He's a wonderful prof; very kind and patient too. Labs were fun, classroom lectures were lively, and if you ever go to his office hours your confusions will be swept away by his clarifications. Labs were relevant to student learning and he cracks jokes every once in awhile. Fantastic time in 213.",
      "Best professor.",
      "I've had George 3 times already, and each time he has proven himself one of the best CPSC instructors at UBC. The accent at first may be difficult, and he has to backtrack a lot, but the most helpful and caring prof around!",
      "Amazing prof! Knows what he's talking about, negotiable and approachable in office hours, and once you get past the accent, will explain anything you ask well and passionately. Definitely taking another course with him.",
      "George is rad, he has a little bit of an accent which honestly helps get you through how dry the course material can be at times. I literally jumped for joy when I realized I had him again next semester.",
      "Following George, you will achieve success easily!",
      "I recommend taking this course with George - he put a lot of effort into the in-class examples. He has a bit of an accent but it only adds to the hilariousness of his jokes! Ops! He really seems to care that his students understand the material. It's a definite advantage for CPSC 313.",
      "George is a really funny and caring professor who needs to get more sleep at night. His accent can be a bit difficult to understands and the lectures fairly dry from time to time but that's life. The course content gets progressively more difficult as it goes on. He can be very lenient. Don't bother asking him \"do you even lift?\" The answer is yes.",
      "He's incredibly fair and lenient with students, but his lectures do often end up being a little on the boring side.",
      "Probably the Best prof I've ever had at UBC. Explains concepts very well, his notes are awesome and his exams are fair.",
      "One of the Best in MSS program",
      "Best prof ever! Exams were really fair.",

      "one of the best profs in cs",
      "Great PROF!! EASILY ONE OF THE BEST I'VE HAD AT UBC!!",
      "A solid professor who knows his material. He treats his students with respect, and wants everyone to do well. However, his accent may make it a bit difficult to understand what he is saying at times. But, you will get used to it. Fair exams and assignments.",
      "VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY GOOD PROF.",
      "Needs to be more clear when explaining concepts. Is very helpful though.",
      "George is very good professor. He is treating all students the same, as his own children. It is also great that he is trying to make everybody understand material. Tough exams.",
      "Like someone said below, the time limit on the midterm was a problem for a lot of students. I almost never have problem finishing exams, but in George's classes I do. It was 8 pages with long descriptions and we were given 50min. Some of his notes and instructions for assign and exams have awkward grammar, but Eng is not his 1st language.",
      "Nice guy, enjoyable lectures, genuinely wants for everybody to do well in his class; the midterm was fair; programming assignments are somehow stressful experiences but adequate help is available, and they are marked fairly.",
      "interesting course materials, challenge assignments, fair exam! recommend&#65281;George is a very nice guy!",
      "The class is very straight forward. George tries his best to explain everything but sometimes I'm not sure if he gets it out the way he intends. Other than that, he's a great guy, and really helpful if you need to get program/course advising.",
      "Very easy and relax environment, need to ask more from students!",
      "In response to his silent students after asking a question: &quot;Come on! It's easy!&quot; hehe",
      "Lecture and Notes r good and useful. fair exams and assignments. A+ prof and also an A+ CS advisor. George is recommended.",
      "Great prof! One of the best I've had so far. His accent is not a problem after 2-3 lectures. Great course; if you did good in CPSC111, this course shouldn't be too hard. Labs are relatively easy. Assignments are LENGTHY but very interesting (for example, making your own game). Probably the most interesting course so far for me.",
      "The lectures are a bit too dense, and by that I mean a lot of not-so-important concepts are presented that are never tested in any way. So lectures can be boring as a result. George is a good prof, and his tests are very fair. If you listen to him carefully you'll KNOW what's on the exams.",
      "George is nice and helpful, but not very organized. He teaches not bad, but has accent, so sometimes hard to understand. Overall, he is recommended.",
      "I like George.",
      "George is fantastic, very helpful and interesting to talk to. This course covered rather tedius material, however... software design principles are just not captivating.",
      "Great prof!",
      "This professor actually really cares if you understand the material. He has taught this course for years and never seems to tire of it. If you ask him a question, he is more than happy to answer.",
      "Easy course. Great guy. Just boring to be in the class at 9AM, when there's only 25/55 registered students present.",
      "Has a desire to see succeed.. his notes are excellent and his exams are directly based on the notes.",
      "Rather good way of teaching. Responsible.",

      "This guy is an absolute legend. One of the funniest profs I have had. Very friendly and approachable too. His ability to explain concepts easily is admirable. His only weakness is that sometimes he tells so many funny stories/jokes that he has to rush the last bit of lecture a lot. So far I have taken 2 courses with him, I would take a 100 more.",
      "Not surprisingly, one of the best instructors in CPSC department. Learning goals are clearly laid out, lectures are clear and a lot of opportunities to learn the materials through pre-class and in-class activities. The workload is medium to light, the exams are very fair. Would recommend to take database courses with Dr Ed Knorr.",
      "Ed's a great prof! He is funny and very approachable outside class. He tries to make lecture content interesting by intersecting a few jokes. His exams are fair but a little too long so they end up tough. He gives a lot of pre and in-class exercises to help you keep on top of the material. My only complaint would be, he talks fast so be prepared.",
      "Lectures are funny and very easy to follow. Exams are fair with nothing unexpected. Favorite cpsc prof at ubc",
      "One of the better CS profs I've had. Great guy with an interesting sense of humor. Midterms were tricky but final was very fair. Easy 4th year CS class.",
      "He gives a lot of homework which makes the course a bit tedious. There are pre- and in-class exercises on top of clickers and three midterms. Staying on top of the course material would be beneficial since the material builds on the previous. Ed is also nice so go to his office hours if you need.",
      "Comedic timing might not always be regarded as an important attribute in a professor, but it definitely contributes to how great of an instructor Ed is. His low-key jokes make it easy to pay attention to material that could otherwise be boring. He is clear about what is expected of you, and he has an incredibly kind and positive demeanour.",
      "Very clear lecture+ useful slides+ office hour",
      "Great Prof! Really inspired interest in the course material. Would definitely take one of his classes again. He really cares about student learning.",
      "Great prof! He really cares about student success. I indtroduced myself once and he remembered for the rest of the term.",
      "Excellent prof who cares about student success. Funny, engaging and great lectures for all levels of understanding.",
      "He is an amazing human being. Genuinely cares about his students' success.",
      "Ed Knorr is THE BEST prof I have ever encountered in UBC and certainly in CS major. He gives very clear explanations and cares a lot about his students' understanding of course materials. Go to his office hours. They are very helpful.",
      "Ive been in UBC for 6 years. Trust me. Hands down, he is THE BEST prof that I have ever seen. TAKE THE COURSE. Some questions may be tricky, but it helps you really think about the material more. Go to his office hours, it will help you.",
      "Ed is so hilarious and he gives credits for i-clicker question and also pre-class exercises, for which solution is given! He explains everything clearly and if you have any ambiguity, he's willing to talk about it for hours :P Office hour is really helpful before exams. His lecture is a pleasure to attend.",
      "Tests are fair. He's a great prof. Extremely clear. One of those classes that if you do all the practice, you'll do well. He has many practice examsassignments and this helped a lot. One of the best profs at UBC.",
      "Ed is one of the best professors at UBC - this is a commonly held feeling among many students. He expects a lot from his students (there is a lot of pre-class readings and exercises); however, this prepares you to obtain a very high mark in the class. If you do the work, you can get an A easily; maybe not so much if you don't do the work.",
      "Best professor so far I have met , feel so warm inside every time I went to his office hour",
      "Excellent professor. Best CPSC professor I've ever had; gives tons of practice material.",
      "I enjoyed the new version of the course. There are 4 midterms and no assignments. Some people may not like the idea of having 4 midterms, but I much rather have that then to do assignments every week. Ed is a great guy and provides PLENTY of practice exams from previous years, so there is no reason not to get a decent mark in the course.",
      "Ed is a great guy and he posts pdf notes online, but he don't always post the annotations. The lab was so hard in the beginning but they changed it half way through. He's really passionate about teaching and I enjoyed him a lot.",
      "Ed is an awesome teacher. His classes are interesting and clear. He loves the subject and has a lot of experiences to share. Be prepared to laugh a lot and learn more.",
      "Awesome teacher!! He is extremely helpful and makes the course very interesting!",
      "He is an awesome guy and an awesome teacher. Try his office hours.",
      "Easily the best teacher I've had at UBC. He is a very good teacher and is always willing to help.",
      "Almost impossible not get an A in his class. Tests are fair and he is a great teacher who is also really helpful and reasonable",
      "His lectures consist of iClicker questions, going over the key concepts from the screencasts posted online, then handing out problems for students to work on in class. occasionally, he does bring about some insights related to computer science/engineering, which are useful informations to keep in mind. Great professor overall.",
      "One of UBC's few good professors",
      "good prof! better then the one that teaches 2nd half of the course",
      "Really great prof. Very fair exams, they follow the assignments very closely. Helps us relate to the real world with his real world experiences in DB. Lots of reference and practice material available for assignments and exams. DO THE PRACTICE! He's always there if you need help and is super fast responding on Vista and returning assign/tests.",
      "Excellent teacher! very helpful, and gives you every opportunity to understand the topic.",
      "I had him for both 304 and 404 and he's AWESOME. He's extremely nice. You can approach him like as if he was your friend. The exams have some tricky questions but the he is really generous when marking. I highly recommend taking any courses with him. He often goes off tangent by telling some stories from his experience, but they're funny &interest",
      "Great prof. Easily understood, friendly, funny, well-organized. His tangents can get a little annoying during lectures, but overall he's the best CPSC prof I've had yet.",
      "Very nice guy, very helpful, definitely easy to learn from. Explains things very well!! Seems genuinely interested in his students getting good grades.",
      "Excellent prof. Great at explaining things, efficient teaching methods, funny guy...etc.",
      "Excellent, very helpful even to students not in his direct section.",
      "Extremely nice and helpful. Teaches pretty good. Ed is recommended.",
      "He is a nice prof. I really enjoyed his lectures and like the way he teaches. He is funny, friendly nd helpfull. His notes are complete nd basically if you read them ,you'll be fine.",
      "very very nice prof, extremly helpful outside of class, checks his email and student bulletin board often, very clear on the material, quite easy tests, and yes he loves hockey alot lol he had some 0 mark questions on hockey on the midterm and the final",
      "He's funny, helpful, and explains really well. He's the best : )",
      "Quite a funny guy to have teaching the class. Friendly guy, and to have us self copy the notes kept me awake (a good thing!). However, the course was a bit hard... Enjoys the canucks a bit too much to mention it in most of his lectures (when he gives examples), and even in the final exam&#63;! Haha.",
      "Ed's lectures are very clear, simple and filled with amusing anecdotes. Perhaps it is just the course material, but nothing about this class was particularly challenging.",
      "Ed is awesome! He's great prof who's organized, his lectures are clear, he puts time into helping his students. On top of all that, he has an awesome personality and tells great stories. Trust me, you want him.",
      "I love this professor. He is simply the nicest professor in computer science in ubc. There's no way any student would dislike him. He is very interesting, hilarious and helpful. I like him alot. He is also the biggest motivation for me to become a professor. Ed, you are the best!",
      "Very helpful and considerate. Lectures are ok but everything is clear as hell. Final exam was piece of cake.",
      "Ed is such a nice guy, and he always has interesting stories to tell. The lectures are a bit boring but he tells you everything to need to do to do well on exams.",
      "The course is tough. But Ed surely spent a lot of time preparing lectures. A lot of notes to add onto the slides in class. Provide good examples for the material. Spent a lot of time for office hours answering questions! Fair on exams.",
      "Easily one of the best at UBC. He answers questions quickly and is fair to students. I dont understand why he makes the assignments worth 20% because many of the students just copy them.",
      "Helpful industry experience examples. Good notes. Fair exams. Great prof.",
      "Good instructor. Very responsible, well prepared, rather clear, considered of students. However, doesn\u2019t feel the auditorium well.",
      "Helpful and considerate to his students and TA's alike. Fair exams.",
      "ok, so he's not the most exciting prof out there, but lectures are clear and he's very, very helpful, and exams are fair. Provides good examples from his industry experience too.",
      "Nice and clear",
      "real good guy... helps everybody at any time",
      "very good at explaining",

      "Good go-to guy when you need help and lectures are good as well. From what I have heard he is on of the better profs to get.",
      "the lecture notes are really helpful. He seems like a very friendly person.",

      "Great prof! His lectures are engaging and informative. He's super nice and and patient if you go to his office hours! He's a fair grader and grades closely to the rubrics.",
      "He is a computer science professor and is extremely dedicated to computer science. Hence he sticks strictly to the marking rubrics when marking essays.",
      "Amazing",
      "Mike is a great speaker. Honestly, this course is one of the toughest I've taken so far. The labs (assignments) are very time consuming and the concepts can take a long time to fully grasp and understand. But still, I learned a lot from this course, and I recommend taking this with Mike :)",
      "Amazing prof. The class is dead silent when he teaches. He commands respect, makes you work a lot but makes the subject super interesting and enjoyable. Hardest course I've taken up until now but also the most enjoyable.",
      "Mike is one of my favourite CS profs! He definitely takes the time to teach you the content and his lectures are super engaging! I would highly recommend taking any courses with him. The assignments are challenging, but totally doable if you pay attention in class. Only critique I have is that sometimes the lecture material is behind in assignment.",
      "Great prof who cares about his students. Assignments can be challenging at times, but exams are very fair. Also very friendly and helpful in office hours!",
      "Mike is one of the best profs I have at UBC. I hope to take class again with him in the future. He sincerely cares and is willing to help when you need it. But if you just want to coast and not put in much work you probably won't like him or the course. Very knowledgable and obviously knows his stuff.",
      "Truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed.",
      "Pretty cool, structured lectures. Office hours are amazing, and he's a great guy with a genuine attitude. He does have a ton of typos though, and isn't the best lecturer, but he'll take the time to teach you everything you need to know if you try as well . His companion is also godly.",
      "He gives great lectures and really wants his students to succeed. I always appreciated when he told people off for talking/being distracting. I found this course pretty tough and the assignments were quite difficult, but if you have to take this class you should take it with this guy.",
      "Mike is one of the best CS professors I've had at UBC. His lectures are fantastic and he explains everything very clearly (with a few dad jokes thrown in). If you ever get confused he is happy to answer questions and is super helpful in office hours as well. Assignments and tests are challenging but you learn a lot!",
      "Mike Feely is just good, clear speaker in his lectures and genuinely cares for his students. We asked for an extension as a class for an assignment and he was reasonable to give us one.",
      "Mike Feeley is a world class computer science professor. That's all you need to know.",
      "Assignments are long and arduous, but as long as you do them and understand them, the class will be fine. Mike is a really nice guy and very willing to help students that are struggling with a concept. Definitely go to his office hours in case something is hard to understand.",
      "Great course! Great Professor!",
      "Feeley is the ultimate dad. On the first day of class he spent an entire 15 minutes wrestling with his laptop to get an animation on one of his slides to work: a singing, dancing lobster. He certainly knows his stuff about systems, but he's a terrible speller, and there's only so many times you can use \"foo\" as an example on your slides.",
      "Cool guy, so glad I took 213 with him. Also very fair and kind to students",
      "Very good at understanding student concerns and questions, but doesn't get thrown off topic. Very well-prepared for class with well-though-out teaching material. Assignments go on forever, but they teach you so much that it's worth it.",
      "pretty chill",
      "Great prof, his lectures are very helpful and his explanations couldn't be clearer. Assignments are very helpful and not very time consuming. An easy class to pass, whether you go to class or not, but if you want to get more than just a good grade (knowledge!!) then definitely attend the lectures.",
      "Awesome guy, helpful, always improves and always answers extra questions(even hard industry ones which most people don't take). Cares a lot about students and how they perform. I would take this course again because YOU WORK HARD but you when you finish you will feel like you just learned MORE than in ALL OTHER courses combined.",
      "very interesting lectures; focuses on confusing subjects; have to pay attention the entire lecture or else you get lost easily; gives grade boosts",
      "One of the bestest profs in UBC computer science. He shows significant interests in computer systems. He is very knowledgeable and able to provide the best help you can get through lectures or from offline discussions (Piazza discussion forum). And lastly, he marked our finals in 6 hours!!!! and our class average ended up greater than 80!!",
      "Feeley is sweet. He is easy going, kind, and smart. Do NOT buy the textbook. I didn't open it once because I attended class and ended up with an A. Exams and assignments are straightforward - students just complicate them. Ask questions if he ever confuses you.",
      "Great course. The material overlaps a bit with 213, but there's a lot of new stuff. Mike Feeley makes the material very clear and the course format (short quizzes) really helps you keep up.",
      "If ever you don't understand something, which is possible given the course material, go to his office. Schedule time with him if you have to. He is very patient and very helpful. He will easily explain anything you want one-on-one.",
      "He is THE BEST!",
      "Good teacher in class, makes things very clear and interesting. However, very unorganized and takes forever to grade.",
      "Very disorganized and takes a long time to mark things. Cool guy though.",
      "He's not a bad prof, the course is really hard.I would suggest not taking it in the summer because 6 months is not long enough to learn everything. He doesnt use the txt at all because he says it's confusing so he made up his own set of notes. Lab material is a bit ahead so it's hard and instructions are very vague. He's trying his best though.",
      "Interesting class.",
      "Interesting but very challenging class. Mike is revamping the way it is taught. There is a hard main project that some students find frustrating or that make them feel helpless to grasp the material in 1mth (summer). Mike tries hard to help & makes himself available as resource -even attends labs. Curr text not helpful but new text is on its way.",
      "the greatest professor i have ever had the pleasure to study under. He is a joy to have in the classroom and he has brought up my confidence and openness of mind 100 fold. He makes my life worth living.",
      "a REALLY good prof!!helpful and friendly,consider of students a lot and learned a lot from him.take his course with no regrets",
      "Extremely helpful instructor, however seemed distracted at times.",
      "A super helpful and friendly instructor. Make sure you get help from him asap if you don't understand something in class. The assignments were a lot of work...I don't know what I learned from them either. lol Midterm was good. Final was a bit harder. The course itself it's not easy, and Mike tries to make it better. ;) Good luck to you.",
      "Good Prof, Class is interesting if you like the material. Attandance is important since it is hard to understand the notes by itself. Assignments are interesting. Exams are very related to the notes.",
      "SUX",
      "Feeley makes an effort to teach tricky material well. The printed notes mean nothing if you don't pay attention. You will get out of the lectures what you put in to them - pay attention and you will learn a lot. He knows his stuff and is more than willing to help you learn it. Very open to questions, and good at explaining concepts.",
      "Great prof, nice guy and very accomodating. His first time teaching this course, so it was a bit bumpy. Tends to underestimate exam difficulty (or overestimate our intellegence). Great 1 on 1. His rendition of 218 is quite a bit harder than previous years",
      "Nice guy, teaches a bit too complex for the lower lvl courses. Final friggin hard.",

      "I rarely call anyone the \"best\", but I think he probably is the best professor I've had in computer science. Hilarious jokes, witty, and very clear lectures. It was also easy to get high marks if you simply keep up. But most importantly, I feel he made coming to class worthwhile and interesting. HIGHLY recommended.",
      "CPSC 221 is a very rewarding course and Kurt is an excellent prof. Clear, engaging lectures, an excellent slide deck, and fair exams. You can't ask for much more!",
      "Amazing prof! So funny and enthusiastic when teaching. Jokes all the time so class never gets too boring. Exams and assignments were not hard at all as long as you keep on top of things and study!",
      "Pretty solid prof! With Paul Carter's screen casts for \"pre-reading\", he does a pretty good explanation of anything extra that may be confusing, but doesn't spend too long on obvious things.",
      "Focuses on concepts and clearly conveys them. Downright hilarious, lectures were enjoyable.",
      "Awesome Prof. Engaging, funny, and clear speaker.",
      "Honestly the best prof I've ever had. He only taught the first half, but I wish he taught the whole class. He was crystal clear in his explanations, and kept the class interesting with humour.",
      "It was his first time teaching this course, but man Kurt can teach anything! Very clear lectures, great teaching style, and fair exams. One of the best profs in comp sci!",
      "Amazing, amazing professor. He should keep teaching the course; was pretty clear in lectures and his TA teams are always top notch",
      "Well, what an amazing professor. He taught really well, and if you understand everything he teaches, then you don't need to even revise for the exams. A lot about it is understanding, so if you understand it then you don't need to worry",
      "Kurt is a great prof. Really cares about the students, and if anybody needs help or has a question he's always right there to make sure it's answered. Exams are pretty easy if you understand the basics. It's a hard course so that's appreciated. Friendly, funny prof. I do recommend taking classes with him.",
      "Clear presentation of concepts, and most importantly humourous. The course is pretty difficult and a bit dull at times, involving lots of work. But he definitely made the best out of it.",
      "Kurt is amazing! He is such a happy guy and his classes are interesting. He uses fun examples and ensures that the class understands what he is teaching. He is funny, and is in tune with the students. He knows when to slow down and give extra help. Exams were very fair and much help was offered for homework and labs. Such a great experience!",
      "Kurt is an awesome prof!! He actually cares about his students and creates such a friendly learning environment. He's entertaining as well, which made the 9am classes enjoyable! I highly recommend learning from him.",
      "At first I wasn't going to take this course, but I am glad that I did. Kurt is an awesome teacher who really cares about his students. In addition, he makes the course interesting, and entertaining at the same time. The midterms and final were fair-most of the questions were based on the lectures and assignments. There was nothing unpredictable.",
      "great professor, i especially love how he went out of his way to try and bring us interesting facts about programming to captivate us (he spent half a lecture once showing us different vending machines), you do learn a lot with him though, and he goes through everything very clearly",
      "Fanstastic prof. Take a course with him if you can.",
      "Kurt is amazing! I never thought I'd like programming but am now considering switching minors. Anticipates problems in his lecture. CPSC 111 in the summer is a LOT of work, but rewarding- prepare to spend ~6-10 hours a day on assignments sometimes. Exams are reasonable. TAs are awesome- can't remember how many times they've saved my project at 1am!",
      "Dr Eiselt is AWESOME! I would take another course with him. He is strict about part marks, but overall a great lecturer and person in general. I will say one thing though, he uses a Mac and thinks it is the only way to go. This is annoying to me, as I only deal with the best, so I stay away from Mac computers. System.out.println(&quot;Kurt is AWESOME&quot;);",
      "You learn so much from Kurt's class because he is a great teacher! His slides are extremely clear and useful, and he seems to know exactly where students might get stuck so he explains and teaches you before you run into the problem. His assignments are fun and challenging. He has a great sense of humor and remembers how it's like to be a student.",
      "great sense of humor",
      "Great, funny prof, easy exams, cant get much better than that",
      "What an enjoyable class! I laughed so much! I also learned a lot. His slides use simple, concise English to explain the ideas. This was one of the few classes I've taken in which I learned more from the lecture than the textbook. Usually, things come together when I read the text. In Eiselt's class, things came together in lecture.",

      "Very interesting in class. You won't fall asleep even early in the morning :)",
      "His class was very easy and laidback. I took it because I needed a cpsc course to complete my degree and was pleasantly surprised to get a professor who didn't speak like a robot. I'd highly recommend any course taught by him.",
      "good prof!",
      "Fair&Honest, He is the one that you would never forget in your life, we have to say THANK YOU UBC for this prof.He (unlike most of the prof in UBC)really tries to help people to enjoy of the time that they spend in school not suffer.One of the characteristic of a good prof is to teach you big picture and to lead you to study details,&he DOSE That.",
      "Hilarious prof. Very clear and precise when explaining course materials. Uses interesting programming examples.",
      "Kurt made my day almost every lecture I went to.Had it not been for him teaching us I would not have attended the lectures too often. HE jokes a lot and the lectures are very informal. We even got to play boardgames on the lectures! Awesome assigments made it really fun programming - even though Prolog or Haskell is not the most exciting languages!",
      "Great teacher, he makes the class fun. Had really interesting assignments to, which makes coding ALOT more fun. The only problem with Kurt is his courses are too easy... he doesn't go into deep anything and you can do pretty well just winging his tests. But lots of people like that... His teaching style is great!!! VERY INTERESTING!",
      "Great prof. Had lots of humorous comments and was very easy to approach with questions.",
      "Awesome prof. Funny and humorous. Love the lecture slides.",
      "An exemplar to all other professors. Easily one of the finest gentlemen to ever teach. It would be to my satisfaction to have Dr. Eiselt replace all other Computer Science faculty members, as they are no longer necessary.",
      "Kurt presents Java programming in an interesting and humorous manner. His Powerpoints are very thorough at explaining the concepts and their applications. In-class practice problems were very beneficial in preparing for midterms. Three assignments, the latter two being extremely time consuming; but these are common to all sections. Final had exactl",
      "No more no say, a great american prof",
      "quite clear and concise but can be long winded at times. he never lost my interest even though it was a morning class",
      "smart, funny, and nice",
      "Very good course. You get to work with a team. The success of your term project will depend on your entire team. Get to know your team members from the start, and make sure everyone is working hard, and you will succeed!",
      "Kurt is very approachable. Always listens to what you have to say. Great examples in class, especially those pre-midterm review sessions, what a life saver. I have to take compsci to satisfy my degree requirements, but am relieved that I got Kurt as my prof.",
      "he's good at demonstrating the actual programming in lectures so that people with no background in computer science could get the new concept more easily. he's funny and is able to bring students with high interest about the course. he's very creative, responsible, and helpful. thx kurt.",
      "Not bad. Like what everyone else said, he definately could have covered a lot more in the course. But then again, maybe he didn't cover too much because this was only an introductory A.I. course. Excellent online summary notes.",
      "Relaxed; a little bit different from the UBC norm of hammernig out the material, gerat when you get used to it. Takes pains to put excellent lecture summaries on the web. I might want to have a cold one in my hand while attending, but hey, I can do with a bit of a break in my schedule.",
      "I think being fair like, Kurt's moving to a new place. I think he could be more symphathetic towards exchange students though. Overall, I really enjoyed his class and his jokes. Eventhough he didn't go into alot of detail. I still think its a great introductory course!",
      "Despite his lack of comic timing, presents material in an easy to learn manner and tests on what we did in class and homework. Only complaint is that he wastes too much time in class and is not able to cover as much or as in depth as he could otherwise."

      "Best prof I've ever had at UBC, course is hard but his lectures and support make everything clear.I will miss having Anthony as a prof, he was the only prof I ever felt like I really had a friendship with, and who would always go overtime in office hours and stay as long as it took to help me, without ever making me feel like he was in a rush to go",
      "Nice.",
      "Really care about his students. Will try his best to explain and make things clear if you are confused. No doubt the nicest prof I've ever had in my life.",
      "Great teacher and spends a lot of time getting to know his students.",
      "He is the best humanity has to offer.",
      "Anthony is a good prof. He's a great prof. In fact, he's so great that all of my friends started going to his class, leaving me alone in the other section. You may think that you had friends, but then it turns out that they're actually Anthony's friends. The moral of the story is that Anthony will steal your friends and with good reason too! :-)",
      "Anthony is the best prof you can ask for. 110 is full of new material (At least 2.5 times a normal course although). Anthony did great with the amazing lectures. His sections for 110 outperform other ones. He is also very accessible and gives good advice outside of class. Very funny too",
      "He's a really nice guy!",
      "Really good prof, caring, respected.",
      "A very kind guy. His lectures were entertaining and he made going over the stuff that we already watched in the videos less boring. He made a course that can be somewhat hard much easier. Lots of office hours as well, so that's a plus. If you want a great CPSC 110 experience, try and get a spot in Anthony's section. You won't regret it!",
      "CPSC 110 is basically a self-study but his lectures always helped me piece together the things I learned through the online course material. Great prof. Anthony is like the Luke Skywalker to Gregor's Obi-Wan. Don't worry, this will make sense after you take this course.",
      "One of the best teachers I've ever had. When I first decided to take 110, it was just to see what all the computer science fuss was about. I had never done anything related to computer science before, but he inspired me to try to pursue it as a major. What I liked most was going to his office hours - he was helpful, funny, and genuinely caring.",
      "He found it hard to talk to and understand me, but you might not have this problem. He was hazy when helping me, but this could be my fault. Nevertheless, I appreciated how good his explanations were, even if he went too fast for us to be able to code and learn without hand-holding.",
      "This was my first formal CS class at UBC, and I have to say that Anthony made it really welcoming. Although I struggled in the beginning, I managed to pick up myself through the hard times. He genuinely wants to help you in class. I really grew to enjoy programming after taking this class and would love to have another class with him in the future.",
      "He is the best prof I ever had at UBC. Strongly recommend.",
      "Anthony is such a legend",
      "The most caring prof I had at UBC. I really hope that I'm able to continue in CS and take more classes with him. He has very hands-on lectures, and he is always willing to glance over your code after class if you can't figure out what's going wrong. His office hours are an amazing resource as well.",
      "By far the best prof I've had at UBC so far. CS in seemed intimidating at first, but the two different teaching styles in Gregor's videos and Anthonys lectures helped me understand the course better and really inspired me to like cs. Anthony also had a LOT of office hrs so u could go ask Qs and do problem sets there with a nice group of people.",
      "He seems to care about student's success. The lecture is solid but only tiny drawback for me is that at his lecture/speaking becomes quite fast after 30 minutes of the lectures or so. Overall, pretty effective.",
      "Anthony is just the best, I have taken 110 &amp; 221 with him and he had made these classes amazing. Not only did he put an enormous amount of work in every day to make a comprehensive powerpoint for lectures, he also made worksheets for every lecture that give us practice in class. His marking is very fair and he truly cares for his students",
      "Anthony is the best computer science prof there is!! He's kind and truly wants his students to succeed. His lectures are very clear and he makes sure everyone understands before moving along! 10/10 would recommend you to take his classes :)",
      "Great explanations. Make sure you go to class to really learn what is going on. The videos can only help so much. Also very helpful during office hours so if you're ever confused, go!!!",
      "Anthony truly cares about his students. He's always available after class or in office hours and answers any question you might have; he makes you feel understood. Also, he's a strong lecturer. The lectures are 'flipped classroom' and he does a great job of breaking down comprehensive practice problems in class that really prep you for exams.",
      "Anthony is one of the best professors i've ever had at UBC",
      "Anthony is awesome! He makes difficulty concepts easy to understand. You can even email him to make an appointment and discuss what you don't understand. Usually you can just work on problems during office hour and ask him questions if you get stuck. He will patiently look at what you have and explain and fix your errors HAHAHA!! He is really good!",
      "Absolutely great guy. Very dedicated and helpful.",
      "He's like the dream prof lol. Really passionate and always helpful",
      "Great professor and person. Lectures can get a tiny bit boring, but he explains things well and really cares about you. A+ would recommend.",
      "Anthony cares so much about his students. Puts a lot of time in outside of class with office hours to help students. Would hold extra hours the weekend before the midterms and final. Really good with names. Explains topics clearly and encourages student involvement in lectures. Might be the best prof I've ever had.",
      "Amazing prof, that definitely cares about his students. Holds so many office hours, and makes plenty of time for personal studying no matter how behind you are. The course is definitely a large workload, but he makes it manageable as possible.",
      "Just a really nice prof overall. Lectures are often a rehash of the videos, but are useful nonetheless; he goes over examples in class. Holds lots of office hours, sometimes even on weekends. Really recommend him.",
      "He makes me love CPSC!! The best lecturer I've ever had, who is willing to devote extra office hours (even during weekends) before exams. He explains programming clearly and really wants to ensure everyone gets it. His paper is easier relevant to Gregor. The online video is time-consuming but helpful for students with no prior cs background",
      "This course is a LOT of work and can be challenging at times, but I can't imagine a better prof than Dr. Estey. Really deeply cares about student learning, takes time out of his day to make students feel valued. He even scheduled extra structured tutorials and tons of office hours in prep for the final, can't recommend highly enough, absolute gem.",
      "Estey was my favorite teacher this term - he's super nice and cares about his students, going above and beyond to make sure they're prepared for every midterm, problem set, and the final. I never went to his office hours, but Anthony goes way out of his way to make himself available to students if they have any questions. Take 110 with him!",
      "a gem!!!! he is the best prof ive ever had. so accessible outside of class, he even puts up extra office hours the WEEKEND before finals and midterms (even though it was thanksgiving). he also seems genuinely interested in helping his students explore this class. this was not an easy class but anthony helped make it better!!",
      "If you are taking CPSC110, do yourself a favour and go to Anthony's section (Even if you're not registered in it). The course itself is hard, but Anthony is amazing! He truly cares for his students' success and will go to extra lengths to make sure we are doing okay and understand the material. He is very approachable and explains things well.",
      "No words can be used to describe him better than &quot;awesome&quot;! Take him for sure!",
      "I love Anthony!!! He is the best prof ever. Super nice, approachable and easy midterms and finals as long as you do the practice. Highly recommended.",
      "Amazing guy - one of the best professor I've ever had. Easy going and friendly, overall a precious blessing to all. Does everything in his power to help us succeed in a difficult course. I struggled a lot but he motivated and inspired me to endure it.",
      "He's very kind and friendly outside classrooms. Very good lecturer and pauses for questions all the time. Definitely recommended!",
      "Fantastic professor that always takes time to help students when he can. He spent at least 12 hours in office hours before the midterms and explains complicated concepts so clearly. He makes an effort to remember your name/ form a connection and is so approachable inside and outside of lecture. Made 213 (kind of a scary course) enjoyable!",
      "Fantastic professor! Very accessible, really cares about his students. He offers so much help, and learnt many of his 200 hundred students names. Made so much review for us and the week of the exam he held like 7 tutorial sessions, and was available all day, everyday including the weekend before the exam. You have to work hard, but he's great!!!",
      "HE is the BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD AND probably will ever have. HE is gold. He like seeing his students succeed and cares about you. I am impressed. There is no better professor in the world than him.",
      "He genuinely cares about his students and puts in the time and effort to ensure everyone understands and is more than willing to set up meeting times outside of class time and office hours to help you succeed.",
      "He cares about all students and willing to answer you any questions. Really want to take his course again!",
      "I think he cares about my learning more than my mom does :) Joke aside, very dedicated to help students. Very reasonable.",
      "Genuinely cares about helping students learn the material. Very approachable, funny and kind. His lectures are very clear. Totally awesome prof.",
      "This guy is the most amazing prof that I have seen up to date from when I entered UBC. His lectures are superb, and he takes time to work through his problems. He's always an hour or two early for his class so you can ask him any questions. He remembers all his students by their names and is a real dedicated prof.",
      "He is really caring. When you see him walking around, he can talk to everyone in the building. It means that he remembers students (faces/names). Just had a midterm, he knew I did poorly without me saying so, because he checked my paper and had expectation on me. I honestly feel blessed and lucky to be in his section. Also straightforward lecture.",
      "Awesome prof, lectures are clear and easy to follow. He is also really helpful during office hours and really cares about his students!",
      "He truly cares about his students by providing extra problems and review sessions. If you are taking CPSC 110, take it with him. The class is very hard, but it's not because of the prof: the material is just difficult regardless of who's teaching.",
      "Great prof. Willing to help out after lectures / office hours. He'll explain everything quite clearly. Really cares about his students."

      "No matter what course she teaches, it is always enjoyable. She is a wonderful professor! Kim is so passionate about everything she teaches, and the assignments are always interesting. Her teaching methods are never confusing or overcomplicated. Unlike some other professors, she is good at what she does, and she does a good job at teaching it.",
      "I don't know if this course is just super easy or if Kim is the best prof ever or if I am just good at programming, but I came in with zero experience and this course was a breeze.",
      "Kim is awesome. I'm in 4th year and she is hands down the best prof I've had at UBC so far. She's extremely nice, very enthusiastic and will answer your questions even at 2am. She is simply the perfect prof. Take any course she teaches.",
      "So helpful!!!!!! Best prof yet! :D",
      "An undergraduate instructor who is both well-prepared and gives a cogent lecture&#63; Unbelievable. It true though. She's solid.",
      "Definitely the best prof I have had at UBC. Lectures are very clear and well planned out, and she goes WAY above and beyond to ensure her students learn the material and get the extra help they need. Not to mention she is an awesome and brilliant person too! She makes the course fantastic!",
      "Best teacher ever!! She spends lots of time answering questions and is EXTREMELY helpful!",
      "You simply cannot be this professor. She is the most energetic, helpful and enthusiastic prof I have had yet.",
      "she is just awesome........... awesome",
      "Wonderful teacher.",
      "Dr. Kim has a remarkable way of explaining things so that anyone can understand. She's kind, considerate and knows her stuff inside and out. Not to mention a brilliant gal.",
      "The best prof I have ever seen at UBC. During the past fours years of study in three different fields I have rarely attended any class since many profs are not helpful. CPSC 260 was different though! I attended every single lecture! Kimberly is an awesome prof! No words can describe how helpful she is. Best prof EVER!",
      "The course itself is hard but she tries to teach it as well as possible. I am not much of a listener in class so I had difficulty following her lecture, though other students will find her much better than the other professors teaching this course. I think the best part of her is that she is more than willing to help during office hours. Take her!",
      "I wish every prof at UBC was like her. She is the most dedicated prof I've seen at UBC in my 2 years so far. She takes her time answering EVERY question you might have. Assignments are challenging though.",
      "Wow. Not many profs know what they're doing and love teaching it, too.",
      "Dr. Voll's class is awesome. I feel like I've learned so much already. It's challenging, though, and you have to practice, but she's really committed to helping in office hours and her lectures help a lot, too!",
      "one of best profs in cs",
      "Fantastic teacher who makes a 2.5hr lecture worth it. Works well with a high paced summer course, always takes time to offer answers to questions (in class and outside), and makes an effort to do so. She's a person who doesn't see teaching as a thing she's forced to do. Kimberly Voll is someone you want to learn from. A good person and good teach.",
      "I don't understand the previous rater's comments!! Kim is AWESOME. I was in that class and attended every lecture and there was nothing that she couldn't answer. In fact, I was impressed with how much she knew. Amazing professor. I will take as many classes with her as I can.",
      "she is nothing but just easy. She is very kind. but she is not knowledgeable AT ALL. although cs subjects intersects with math a lot, she cannot answer any of math related question. You can get an A easily with her, but you wont learn anything. she should not be teaching at UBC.",
      "Definitely THE BEST prof i've ever had. She is always helpful and her class is fun. Don't really need to buy the textbook, her lecture slide is sufficient. However, the only negative thing I would say is that sometimes there are questions in the lecture slide, but she doesn't provide the answer!",
      "I haven't completed this course yet but so far she seems like an easygoing nice prof. The only thing is that she has too much unnecessary stuff to say which makes what is important not so clear. I'm bit worried about learning materials from her",
      "One of the nicest prof's I've had. Her door is always open and she's always happy to answer questions. Labs can be extremely frustrating and the assignments are challenging - in a fun way - but the midterm and final are pretty easy. Overall, I definitely recommend choosing a section that she teaches.",
      "Easily the best professor I have ever had at UBC. Always available for questions/help with the material and she has a way of explaining things to anyone so that they make sense. Very fair and considerate.",
      "She is an extremely caring and helpful professor who wants all of her students to succeed. As well, she is very active on the discussion boards, and she gives fair exams and assignmenets. Easily one of the best instructors you will ever get!",
      "She has the best teaching style. I often wondered during lectures if she has a PhD in Education, too, as well in the class she is teaching (Cognitive Science). Yes, she is that good! Always available, and she simply just knows how to explain things so ANYONE can understand. Outstanding!",
      "She is the best professor ever! All profs should treat their students the way she does. She is helpful and knowledgeable. You actually learn the material with her.",
      "Enough said, she is the best! =D",
      "You won't regret taking courses with her. I've taken CPSC 221 and COGS 200 and she always shows care and patience towards the students. She's the best prof I've had in my undergrad year. I'd definitely recommend her. Not only she's nice, but she really wants you to grasp the concepts. I'm really grateful that I had her for CPSC.",
      "The best CPSC prof!",
      "Kim is quite simply the best. Its amazing having a professor at UBC that actually cares about whtether or not you succeed and Kim sure does!",
      "She is a sweetheart!",
      "She is very cute!",
      "I have to say, she is awesome! the bestest, the nicest prof i had in my 4 years at UBC! she is so hug able and sweet, very smart woman, and so passionate with all the courses she teaches! Very understanding of students, so helpful in office hour and webct and even with boring subjects, she makes them so much fun, that you dont want to miss a class.",
      "Kim and Kurt are the best profs I've had at UBC. She is really nice, and she communicates her expectations fair and square. She definitely makes you do the work, but nothing that came from her was unreasonable. If you do the work, you will do fine because she is fair on assignments and exams. She tells funny stories and has a sense of humour.",
      "Kim is definitely one of the nicer instructors I have encountered in the 3 years I have been at UBC. She made her expectations very clear and did an adequate job of explaining the concepts. The midterm and the final were definitely fair, and she is a fair marker without a doubt! I definitely recommend her!",
      "Agree with all previous posts that she is the most approachable and nicest prof I have met at UBC. I took this course in the summer, and I think the pace is just OK. The material itself is relatively easy,and her midterms are pretty easy. and the final might be a bit hard, but not really. But the assignents might take lots of time, I really RECOMME",
      "Probably one of the best profs not just in the CPSC department, but at UBC. I took this course in summer, so material was very fast but she still managed to teach very effectively. Has great concern for her students and does as much as possible to help. The course itself is tough so its still your responsibility to keep up with labs and readings.",
      "Seriously one of the best profs at UBC. She is unbelievably approachable and does her best to help her students succeed. Going to class and labs is important, and staying on top of your work - there is a lot. She's a fair marker and makes fair exams. I would absolutely recommend this for filling a science requirement.",
      "She's one of the best profs I have had so far. Very engaging, witty, and not overly enthusiastic. I sleep in/skip pretty much all my classes but I looked forward to her lectures every week. Her assignments/midterms/finals aren't easy though. If only she teaches all the CS classes. Highly recommended.",
      "Very very good prof, amazing ability to teach.. excellent course for those beginning or wanting an introduction to comp sci..her marking is fair and easy, work is not hard at all either...",
      "Really great! She's an awesome prof who really makes the class worth attending!",
      "Very helpful. She will reply to any email as soon as possible. Has many office hours but you can book an appointment with her if you need to. Makes a lot of good relevant jokes. Her lectures are worth attending. She convinced me indirectly to change majors to Computer Science.",
      "Awesome! She clearly knows what she is talking about and she makes it really fun and interesting. The most helpful prof I have encountered at UBC, if you need to turn something in late or make up a quiz, she is great about it. Make sure you check online for announcements though, that's her main mode of communication.",
      "Very engaging lecturer, very knowledgeable, clearly enthusiastic, and will go out of her way for you if you ask for help. I honestly have no criticism for this prof, and cannot recommend her highly enough. And come on people, vote hot. She's pretty!",
      "The best prof I've ever had! She's funny, inspiring and considerate of her students. Even though the class ended at 5:00 (which is pretty late for me) I absolutely enjoyed every minute of it!",
      "AWESOME prof! First day she came in happy, telling jokes (decent ones too, not just lame stupid stuff), and was really clear. Totally reasonable with questions, concerns etc. throughout the course, and was always willing to help! Highly HIGHLY recommended.",
      "Easily communicates her enthusiasm for cognitive science. Wide knowledge of subject's history, philosophies, technologies, and current events. Emphasizes discussion and student initiative in her teaching style, making classes entertaining and intellectually rewarding.",
      "Awesome prof, simple essays, easy tests. Genuine interest in her feild, fun and funny.",
      "Good instructor. Lays information out clearly. Exams are fair and straighforward. She will definately take the time to make complex ideas more comprehensible.",
      "shes really good at clarifying stuff and has a genuine interest in what she teaches"

      "Very well organized, concise, and clear. Tests methodically covered all sections of the lecture. Labs were time consuming, but not impossible (ave. 10hrs per lab). Harinder has since moved to SFU; UBC's loss.",
      "Harinder's a pretty cool prof, but some of his assignments are just crazy. We had one which contradicted itself in multiple locations, and the assignments are often too big to do well in a reasonable amount of time. There's also an assignment due at midnight the night before the final... definitely not cool. Ah, the joys of summer.",
      "Interesting, informative, and well-structured course for those with little or no CPSC background. He is possibly one of the best professors at UBC.Instructs in a clear and concise manner that any competent individual can comprehend and achieve a good grade.Professors like him come few and far in between at UBC; take the opportunity while you can.",
      "Harinder is a great professor, but sucks at hockey...go flames go!",
      "The instructor is of a very good quality but: *The lectures notes are very week and often do not reflect the real world picture *The material covered is very shallow, by asking questions you do not get the real answers. Bottom line: taling courses is fun but not very informing",
      "Notes and lectures are extremely clear and easy to understand. Tests are very fair imo, and are based directly off the lectures, but there are some 'deeper understanding' questions on exams as well. So understand, don't just memorize the material. Well-organized, helpful prof. A+",
      "Harinder's lectures and notes r great. he is also very apporachable and helpful. Hardiner is recommended~~",
      "The course is easy to start with and his notes is very well organized. His exam is all based on his notes so come to class!!! Also, there is not much reading to do.",
      "The problem is once you miss the lecture, you miss the notes, and you miss it all!Notes is the only thing you can depend on",
      "Very easy course. Prof is very easy to understand and gives very clear notes. As long as you have all the notes you can do well in the class.",
      "Very nice prof., course represented very clearly. five-star rating",
      "He knows so much and is patient and clear and a NICE GUY. Really a great prof.",
      "Stupid course, but nice professor",
      "After taking this course, i know so much more about computers(not like i don't kno anythin in the first place).Bet i kno more bout comps than u ppl who didn't take it.His exams are relatively easy and his notes clear and organized.My TA was good too, but the programming part was a bit tricky.",
      "A FANTASTIC prof! I really enjoyed his course, and he is very patient. Sitting in one of KHAN-GURA'S classes is like being in SHAN-GRALA!",
      "I love this guy, probably one of the best professor at UBC",
      "wow!! his notes are so clear!! very easy to understand!! he is a great prof...fair midterm and final. the labs for this course are not that hard...just requires thinking. once u complete a lab, you feel you learned a lot!",
      "This course is easy but not THAT easy as everyone says it is. You really have to go over his lecture notes in order to do well on his midterm and final.Make sure you do not screw up since this is a 4-credit course.",
      "dont take this course as a science credit! its such a waste of time and its not as easy as what everyone else says it is",

      "this prof is really really nice and helpful. Exams are straight-forward and relatively not too difficult. Remember to read the text for the final.",
      "Exam grading structure is quite unfair. Equivalent points are deducated for every wrong answer, so this is a double whammy which brings your grade down. i.e., 7/10 correct, you are deducted 3 points for the 3 incorrect for a mark of 4/10.",
      "a wonderfurl human being in every sense of the word, and the cutest.",

      "Although he's a huge Leaf's fan, he's a pretty good prof...of course, it helps that a 3 year old could get an A in CPSC100 but hey...who cares&#63; I don't think I even went to class and I got an A.",

      "good course and he taught it well.",

      "good",

      "definitly recommend taking 315 with him. best damn prof around",

His lecture style really helped me (encourages discussion about material and focuses on making sure we actually learn), literally every lecture was worth going to. He explained difficult topics very clearly, seriously wish he taught all my courses. If you have a chance to take a course with him, do it!",
      "Mike is a great lecturer, and clearly cares about students. Go to office hours, he's more than happy to explain concepts. 340 is not easy, but it's super interesting and Mike does a great job teaching it.",
      "Mike's not only a great lecturer, but very accommodating in office hours. He's got a real knack for explaining tough concepts, and you can tell he really cares about his students.",
      "He's a very caring and engaging Prof, would definitely recommend taking 340 under him! Lectures are interesting and he's a dope guy in general.",
      "Mike is a great Person and truly inspirational! Assignments are challenging and do take up time but don't let that put you down. they are FUN!! If you have an interest in the course material, You will be making a huge mistake not taking his class! TAKE IT, TRUST ME DUDE :)! Mike DA REAL MVP",
      "Absolutely one of the best profs in UBC I have ever had.",

Both may be hard, but I feel that the exams and assignments were some of the most fair, interesting, and well written of any course I've ever taken.",

      "Maybe the best prof I've had at UBC. 340 is not an easy course by any measure and has LOTs of stuff; but Mike and his team nailed it!",
      "Great teacher and nice classes. Didn't even know what coding was until his lectures and now I want to take other comp sci classes. He is very helpful when you ask him questions but doesn't appreciate being asked the same question by multiple students via email, so try to ask others around you before hand or even during class. Looks like Frodo.",
      "Mike is a great instructor! Very clearly passionate about the material. Tough course but I would've done much worse without his teaching. Lots of long assignments but they were core to helping me understand the material. Hope the department can manage to keep him around cause he's great.",
      "Mike is a great professor. I had him for APSC 160. His lectures are well structured and easy to follow. Being a coding class, some people may find his courses difficult. But if you watch the screen casts (also very well made and easy to follow), then the class shouldn't be too difficult.",
      "Mike was a phenomenal professor and probably the most genuinely caring instructor I've ever learnt from. His lectures were fantastic and I always looked forward to them. He's an extremely genuine prof without an ego which is really rare. If you get the chance to learn from him, don't pass it up. One thing to know is that he assigns a lot of work!",
      "Very easy course - Michael is a great professor and explains programming concepts clearly. Just watch the screencasts before class, take some notes, and you will do perfectly fine.",
      "Cool prof doing a good job for his first year at UBC. Easy A class even for non-programmers.. Watch screencasts and do in-class assignments and it should be a breeze."

      "Elisa is always energetic and enthusiastic, she tries to make the boring java concepts interesting. She really cares about students and encourages them. But the course CPSC210 is not easy to get good grades, the final and midterms are always hard. She is a good professor!",
      "I know Ms. Elisa from edX online courses. She is inspirational. She has wonderful speaking and teaching skill.",
      "Really good prof, very similar teaching style to Anthony Estey if you took CPSC110 with him. She is super caring and wants to make sure everyone understands the material. Very laid back and approachable, definitely recommend taking it with Elisa!",
      "So happy I took CS210 with Elissa. She is super clear in explanations and always put time for students before and after the class and office hours. Her lectures are inspiring and she always have examples to refer to while teaching various concepts. The project was super cool and she had super cool ideas to handle our project. Awesome Prof.",
      "This year's offering of CPSC 210 has gotten more challenging compared to the previous years.. The penalty for the in-lab quizzes are brutal, like 0.5 percent of your WHOLE grade is deducted. Elisa doesnt reaaaally prepare you for those quizzes/midterm. Overall, the course was fun with personal projects but grading scheme has gotten harsher.",
      "voice is soft as butter",
      "Elisa is awesome. Her quiz-style assessment system (new this term I think) was a super way to know how you were doing at all times with the main course concepts. Wish all courses were done this way (and that all profs could be as great as Elisa).",
      "Elisa is an amazing professor. I only went to a handful of classes all semester because it is my only class and in the morning but she was excellent in all of them. Super engaging and moves at a student-friendly pace. All material is posted online so lectures are not mandatory. Exams aren't too bad though the format is a little weird.",
      "Great prof. Has repeatedly gone out of her way to help solve problems I'm having with courses. Marking is fair and feedback is constructive. Lectures are fun and hilarious and the improv coding examples are always super creative and interesting. UBC Comp Sci profs are pretty hit and miss, choose elissa if you have the option",
      "Hilarious instructor. Lectures were well-paced. Labs were fun. Exams were fair. Didn't know any java going in and did fine.",
      "Just overall an amazing teacher",
      "Elisa is truly an amazing prof. Her lectures are neat and extremely helpful. She genuinely cares about her students and tries her best to answer their questions. She is also funny. I would definitely recommend attending every lecture and going to her office hours.",
      "Has a good sense of humour, which makes the lectures more effective. There's an agile group project and it's not very well-executed. You need to write a large number of user stories (tedious, feel likes waterfall) and prioritize them and there are only 2 sprints (not enough time on implementation). There's Piazza which is a huge help.",
      "Funny, nice, great lecturer. Exams were clear and simple. The project was a bit of work but it makes for really good experience.",
      "Honestly just an absolutely amazing instructor. Lectures are very enjoyable and engaging. Really cares about her students, and an overall very reasonable prof.",
      "She's an amazing prof! lectures are hilarious and clear :) My best prof at UBC so far.",
      "Elisa cares about her students, is funny, and makes lectures engaging. She will give her students the support they need and genuinely wants them to do well. While there is a lack of feedback and it's kind of ambiguous what her expectations are, you can always ask Elisa and she'll respond super quickly most of the time. Project was the best part!",
      "One of the best profs I've ever had. Her lectures are by far the most entertaining and enjoyable. She is super nice, helpful, and genuinely wants her students to succeed.",
      "Elisa is such a nice prof and is very approachable. She recognizes the faces of her students and always says hi to you whenever you bump into her on campus. Her exams are fair and genuinely wants her students to succeed.",
      "Elisa is amazing. Although I miss a few lectures, the ones I attended were always entertaining and quite informative. Elisa knows how to make the driest compsci material as interesting as possible. Thought 310 would be a pain but Prof. Baniassad definitely made it something to remember. I love you Elisa!",
      "Easily one of the best Comp Sci instructors. Pretty casual class atmosphere - she does a great job clearly explaining the concepts. Very friendly and willing to help students.",
      "She cares so much about student grades, and really wants her students to excel. She lets you hand in in-class exercises without having gone to that class, because \"people get busy and can't make class sometimes\". She is really funnydramatic in her lectures, and I feel very comfortable approaching her outside of class time.",

Pace of the course is not super fast so it's not a big deal. Only negative about Rachel is sometimes she's condescending towards students when students ask questions and comes in late.",

The textbook is only truly crucial if you might skip lectures. She is very helpful (she walks around and helps students randomly during in-class activities).",

      "great prof! she's probably the most devoted prof i've seen. very excited about the subject she's teaching as well. i learned a lot and did well in this course, thanks to rachel! HWs are well-designed. she cares about the students! although, sometimes she talks very fast. you need to focus in class to get the best out of it.",

Homework is submitted online and you are allowed to keep submitting until you get it prefect... providing me with the most amount of learning and least amout of stress of any CPSC class I've taken. I highly recommend her!!",
      "Rachel is the most enthusiastic prof I have ever had. She is extremely eager and obviously wants us to learn as much as possible. She makes a potentially boring subject fun, and knows the subject inside and out. Very bright, a great teacher, and has generated applause from the class. Sometimes gets a little over excited and can go quite fast."

      "Amazing lectures and explanations. He did a better job teaching some system concepts than THE computer engineering professor. Still his labs are disastrous. He never gives a marking rubric sometimes you do not even know what should be the right output of the homework. His tas are very useless and he does not reply piazza posts. Go to office hours!",
      "I wrote a review a while back when I took 210 with. At that time, his lectures were subpar, but was decent during office hours. But after taking 313 with him, he is one of the most improved and currently one of the best instructors in UBC CS. His lectures are great and very to the point. He may not be most fun prof but he is great at teaching.",
      "He is readily available on Piaza, providing help for students. I have not seen more dedicated instructor. He seems to be expert in what he is teaching and always well prepared for lectures. However, his pace is fast, dense materials and you need to be taking good notes. Also, exams are not easy but fair. Take his class for 313.",
      "CPSC 313 is not an easy course by any measure. It has many difficult topics and assignments, but Jonathan was great at communicating them. He is one of the best profs I had at UBC. He knows what he's talking about and how to teach students. Slides are great but make sure to take notes of what he says. Amazing prof! I'd take him over any other.",
      "Jonatan is a great prof! He really cares for his students, and he's super nice! His lectures are really informative so you wouldn't want to skip them.",
      "He is a very good lecturer, always available and ready to answer questions in his office. Lectures are relevant to current topics discussed in the news, so he doesn't just recycle old material. Highly recommended.",
      "If you can focus on his lectures, it's not hard to keep up with the course material, as all relevant material is in his class notes, and he provides adequate examples. Labs could be a bit heavy but there was always enough time to finish them. He owns up to his mistakes, is always open to answer questions. Grading of exams and labs was fair.",
      "Explains concepts quite clearly and answers questions in a really intuitive way. The lecture slides were really helpful and assignments and exams are closely related. Could have improved the lectures on synchronization a bit, I figured out the details with an amazing TA as it wasn't explained super clearly in class.",
      "One of the reasons I think Jonatan is an amazing prof is because of how he opens the lecture to student participation. He tries to answer everyone's questions during lectures, which gave us an even deeper understanding of the course material.",
      "Jonatan's lectures are very clear and he can be entertaining at times. The material is hard but he always tries to help students to the most of his ability.",
      "Jonatan is a great prof! He was a TA for many years so he is great to get help from as I learned when I went to his OH for help on assignments and he's really helpful on Piazza as well. He's also a great lecturer. While the material can be dry he tried his best to make it understandable with analogies and relating it to things today.",
      "Jonatan is a caring guy that wants the best for his students. Everything on the exams are covered in lectures. He posts lecture slides, but leaves out some stuff, so go to lecture and take good notes.",
      "Speaks as clear as he can and take loads of questions, so expectedly his lecture is very accommodating to the slower students. He uses flipped classroom format so be prepared to read/watch screencasts, but the grading scale is fairly forgiving. Answers online question very quickly and helpfully.",
      "very big learning curve and pre readings are mandatory for the course. His lecture game ain't the best. However, he's always helpful when your stuck and tries to explain concepts if you don't understand it."

      "Really great prof. He clearly cares about your success as a programmer, and is honest about what course content is relevant to your career and which isn't. The labs, assignments, and project is straightforward, although the XML lab is tough if you're not already familiar with XML. You must attend the lecture, both for the content and his dad jokes.",
      "Great prof. One of the best I've had so far. He's extremely easy to follow. You should come to class and pay attentiontake notes. Really interesting course as well. The assignments are long but they'll probably be the same with any prof.",
      "Decent lecturer, but make sure to take notes in class since his slides don't say much. You will miss a lot of important stuff. Doing the his practice questions should give you a good idea of the content for the midterm and final. The exams focus mostly on what is covered in lecture and less on the coding done in the labs.",
      "Awesome professor! If you just do the readings prior to attending class (like it is required), he is easy to follow in class. He is very approachable and has a great sense of humour.",
      "He is a great prof. He is smart and helpful. The course is one of those courses that you might either understand the materials or you won't! It scares you at the beginning but it is not hard. Norm's MTs were fair but the final was a bit more challenging.",
      "Explains well, quite helpful and interested in the material. I would totally take another class with this guy. Don't take 313 unless you are a CS major - I am and I liked it. Read the book, it's good.",
      "A He is a very very talented programmer and he can spot any errors in algorithms almost immediately(while some TAs' spent hours). A great lecturer with a very good sense of humor. I've enjoyed his use of funny expressions in his lectures. A great prof that u will enjoy and learn lots from.",
      "Great teacher. Funny, made it easy, good notes. Not a hard class, well taught",

Choose your partner well and the project will be a breeze. The true/false midterm/final is annoying, but studying for it really just involves going over the videos/notes.",
      "Material seemed conceptual at the time but ended up being super useful on my next co-op term. Video lectures have been really nice for review while on co-op too.",
      "Really funny and knowledgeable guy. Made this course a lot better than what it used to be. You'll learn a lot in this course. His exams are a pain though. 150 T/F Final? No practice questions and no clearly defined learning goals? A recipe to drop the class average artificially. Other than that, great experience. Start the project early.",

      "Reid video taped all his lecture material and put it online this year. This ended up being great for me because I was ab,le to review the weeks content in advance and only go to lectures when I knew I needed more time to work on the tricky material class time was mostly spent on hands-on activities, so those were useful and fun in general.",
      "Had this class last term. Lecture material was fairly conceptual which made it hard to know what was right, but the project was really concrete and helped me get some of the experience my friends who have done co-op already had. Great class!",
      "Don't understand the complainers. The midterm was tough but straight from the notes. Good project, but i chose my partner well.",
      "Applied prof who gave lots of industrially relevant examples. Midterm was multiple choice and was tough because of the negative marks but were all taken from the provided readings. Lots of energy in class, but if you don't do the in-class activities the lectures can be a bit boring.",
      "Awesome professor, very industry oriented, unlike many other computer science professors, he really supports industry-like software engineering and teaches what's new in industry. Be prepared for a hard real-world like project, it's tough but I'm pretty sure you're gonna learn and be quite hire-able.",
      "Tough realistic project but I learned a lot. Really relied on my partner and I'm glad I chose well. Be ready to put in the time for this project. If you don't want to write any code, this class would be hard. Lectures were long because it was a night class but had lots of hands-on activities."

      "One of the best :)",
      "Very bad professor. Instead of giving serious lectures she makes jokes and pop culture references. Canceling programming assignments at the end of the term when students are most eager to learn. The grading scheme is very loose. Students can get many free marks by attending labs simply. If she teaches 320 next year you need to avoid her at all cost",
      "CPSC 121 is known to be a hard course but when you take it with Cinda, you'll realize that she explains the concepts clearly. Although she confuses herself sometimes in the lecture, but that doesn't really matter. She could have been more specific on some topics though.",
      "I struggled very much in this class, but that I blame on myself and not the prof. The prof was enthusiastic and very clear on all the concepts. She brought popcorn and timbits so thats a plus too.",
      "She's a good teacher, bit unorganized and unclear at times but it makes no big impact to understanding. Very kind and friendly, and easy to listen to. Would recommend for sure.",
      "Great teacher, lots of good examples, funny (at least she tries), sometimes takes too long to get the simple stuff across and then has to rush through the more complex stuff.",
      "One of the most charismatic lecturers I have ever met, with the ability to somehow make a 2.5 hour lecture enjoyable. Although lectures were rushed at times, office hours really helped with clarifying more difficult concepts.",
      "Professor Heeren is the best professor I ever had. I love the way she teaches and involves students in the class. Also, She created the group midterms which give the chance to know the pathway other students approach to solve the problems. She is great in teaching CS121 by relating the material to upper year courses (CS221). Overall. AWESOME.",
      "Great lecturer who cares a lot about ensuring everyone's understanding of complex topics. She was on the class forum answering questions 24/7 all semester, and was very available and approaching in office hours. I found the workload and marking schemes for homework and exams to be very fair, and would definitely recommend taking a course with her.",
      "One of the BEST CS prof I've ever had at UBC. She has an amazing and attractive character. Her lectures are very energetic and make me very comfortable. Exam and assignments are a lot more challenging than 210. Would definitely take her class again.",
      "Cinda's a really great prof, probably one of the best cs-lecturers I've ever had. She's really enthusiastic and makes you seem less afraid about the material. However, her exams and programming assignments are EXTREMELY difficult. Compared to previous years, the PAs and exams were much much much much harder..",
      "Shes very enthusiastic about the subject. Will highly recommend. Although exams are hard..",
      "One of the nicest profs you'll ever meet. Can be slow during class sometimes as she answers everyone's questions. Final was made somewhat different from what we were taught in the syllabus.",
      "This was her first semester teaching at UBC so there was some bumps along the way but overall, Cinda is a cheerful enthusiastic prof. She keeps the class engaged. Exams/assignments are tough but I think Wolfman has more control over these topics as both sections were sort of co-taught.",
      "Cinda is awesome! Take her if you can. She explains algorithms super well and in a way that's easy to understand and remember. The course was a little disorganized, but I'm sure that'll get better as she teaches the course more",
      "Cinda is a very welcome addition to UBC. Lectures are great and really help to develop intuition, exams are fair (and fun!), and her office hours are extremely helpful. Assignments/exams are creative and seem designed to test your understanding of the material rather than your ability to regurgitate information. Highly recommended."

      "Best prof in the CS dept I've ever met, taken both CPSC 320 and CPSC 421 with him and wished to have more. Absolutely fantastic.",
      "Nick's lectures are AMAZING - good pace and very clear. Concerned about student learning, assignments are hard but worth the effort. He puts in a lot of effort into his teaching and incorporates new research into the material. You can't go wrong taking a class with Nick. I love his sense of humor and he is a very nice guy in general.",
      "He really cares about his students, lectures at a very good pace, gives fun and challenging homeworks, makes himself accessible outside of class and incorporates silly jokes into the lecture when you least expect it. One thing I really admire about Nick is that he is very humble, despite being insanely intelligent.",
      "Amazing prof, my 2nd class with him after CPSC 320. Great lectures, good pace, very clear, answers questions, makes funny remarks, cares about students. Assignments in 421 are hard but they're a lot of fun and really make you learn the material! Exams are easy. Definitely recommend taking 421 with Nick.",
      "Dr. Harvey was an amazing instructor. I only wish he would teach more courses ...",
      "Nick is the man! Super clear and one of the nicest guys you will meet. Fairly challenging but is fair about scaling if the exam was too tough. I would have loved to take this course with Nick in the fall instead of the summer. Would go out of my way to take classes with Nick!",
      "Prof. Harvey is a great professor, he made a very difficult class in 320, bearable and enjoyable. I have heard stories that 320 was one of the hardest classes in the CS world at UBC, and choosing to take it in the summer with Nick was one of the best decisions I made. Very personal, writes great notes, and makes sure his students understand. 10/10.",
      "This prof is fantastic. Any student in CS at UBC should try to take a class with this prof. His lectures are great and he stays after lecture (every class) to help students. Midterm was very easy, final was harder but fair, as it was scaled more than enough to compensate for the increased difficulty.",
      "Lectures are extremely clear. Takes time to be available after class to answer questions. Keeps class entertaining by engaging class in discussion. Tells amusing anecdotes to explain concepts.",
      "This prof is absolutely amazing, one of my favourite prof's ever. His lectures are fantastic, he's super friendly, and he's always willing to help out. Also very fair exams and assignments. Couldn't ask for a better prof.",
      "He is now one of my favourite teachers! I took 320 in the summer, knowing that if I took it during winter, I would be struggling. Nick is an amazing teacher, easy to understand, he goes slow, and he explains things very clearly. He wrote on the whiteboard, which made it easy to follow along. I would definitely take more classes taught by him.",
      "Wow. Very friendly, amazing lectures. Makes sure everyone understands. His explanations are clear, you get to learn a lot, takes feedback from you and works on them. His demos included professional work that he had done. I am very inclined to take other courses with him. Highly recommended. Only wish assignments and exams were a little harder.",
      "So funny and midterm was easy. So glad I took 320 with him. He goes at a slow and good pace.",
      "It was his first time teaching the course. He removed the material he didn't think was necessary and the class ended up being easier than previous sections. Very clear lectures.",
      "On the first day of class Dr.Harvey's first statement was, \"I have never taught a second year level cpsc course.\" I heard bad things about 221 already and that was the last thing I wanted to hear. Now that my cpsc 221 course is over, I could not be happier that Dr.Harvey was my prof. Great prof but even better than that he's a great guy!",
      "He takes some getting used too but once you do he is awesome."

I don't know if I've met a professor who is as clear as her when it comes to learning goals, especially during exam time. Got me from a D midterm to an A+ final grade :)",
      "She is very nice as a person but her lectures can be boring at times. If you have a hard time paying attention in class then I don't recommend taking her class. However, if you are a &quot;good&quot; student then she is probably one of the best profs out there because she explains everything very well with lots of examples.",
      "She is a nice person. Her class is amazing and very clear.",
      "Before going into CS 245, I was expecting it to be the worst course I've taken thus far at uW, judging purely based on the previous reputation of the course. Early on in the term, Alice acknowledged the horrible reputation of the course, and was determined to make it better for us this term. That's exactly what she did. Thanks for the great term.",
      "Alice is new prof and the class I took with her was her first time teaching. She's absolutely amazing, caring and made the course super fun. I went into this course not hearing great stuff about it but came out having my perspective completely changed because of her. I would 100% recommend anyone who's taking CS245 switch into her section.",
      "An amazing prof - her notes were very well-written, making it possible to understand material despite skipping class. She also genuinely cared about all of her students to the point that she could look at a number of students at the beginning of the first day of class and call them by their names, and gave us a pep talk right before our midterm",
      "She works really really hard to get this course going, must say she's a legendary for cs245, she offers handout in her class(few hundred copies), and I have seen how she stapled each copy one by one ALL by herself. Seeing Alice, I kind of get why I can't get into Harvard(like she did), and u definitely should take this course with her U WONT REGRET",
      "Really helpful both in and outside of class. Found the course content to be a bit boring, but she definitely made it better and do-able. Would have died of boredom and failed the course if not for her.",
      "I don't even take this course with her but I use her notes to study. Her notes are simply legendary and better than any textbook/coursenotes I have ever seen.",
      "Puts a lot more effort into teaching the course than the other professors. Real focus on understanding the material through in class exercises rather than students just blindly copying notes or slides. Her notes are nicely written, straight to the point and posted online so you can focus on solving the problems in class. Very good teaching style.",
      "Excellent teacher - genuinely cares about your learning, and is very happy to help if you show that you've actually tried. Notes and explanations are very clear, only criticism is that she sometimes runs out of time.",
      "She neatly handwrites lots of good notes + proof examples that I know students from other sections study from as well. In lectures she encourages participation/engagement while trying to remember peoples names. Once in a while she'll have a blurp where her explanation is confusing but it wasn't a bother for me.",
      "She's awesome and very understandable. Sometimes her lectures stretched too long for the time period. Her handwriting is amazing and she gives out candies to students who participate.",
      "Ever since Professor Alice Gao started writing the midterms for this class, the average grades have significantly dropped. Midterm 1 went from high 80s to low 60s. That having been said, Alice is definitely an engaging and clear professor, and I would recommend taking her section since you won't escape the common midterms either way :P",
      "Even though she's a post-doctorate researcher as opposed to a \"professor,\" she teaches more effectively than most \"professors.\" Take a class with her if you have the chance. Show up to every lecture and don't skip class."

He gets REALLY excited when someone does something better/faster than expected, and throws candy. One time he brought us all chocolate because he won a gambling game we made in class",

However, that could be because the subject material was not extremely difficult compared to an algorithms course. Hassan maintained a positive attitude throughout the course and slides were always posted on time.",

Hassan was one of the best instructors I have had at UBC so far",

By far, the best CPSC course I've ever taken.",
      "This dude is pretty awesome! He is clear, and very helpful! He is also a very nice guy and genuinely wants his students to succeed."

      "Celina is honestly one of the most genuine, kind, and caring profs you can ask for. She will never hesitate to take time out of her day to help you understand concepts and clearly explains them in a way where you will actually learn instead of memorize. I can't even express how much commitment and dedication she puts into her students' learning!",
      "Great professor. It was her first time teaching 213, but you could tell she really wanted all of her students to succeed; as years go by, she'll only get better at teaching the course. Course was pretty easy to start, got tougher towards the end, so going to lecture is crucial. Overall, can't go wrong with Celina.",
      "Celina's lectures are great until that day when you're too tired to write anything on her handouts and you're left with nothing to study off of",
      "Pretty good",
      "Celina is one of the best profs you could ask for to teach CPSC110. She genuinely cares about her students' learning and is so approachable. As a complete beginner to programming, she instilled such confidence in my coding because her lectures were so clear and helpful. Overall, a super knowledgeable, fun and respected prof! Had a great time!",
      "Ideal prof for an introduction to computer science. Despite never having coded before, I wasn't intimidated because she went into computer science herself without any previous experience. You don't HAVE to attend class, but it helps A LOT. If you make the effort, she cares and is very accessible (especially when the course work gets hard).",
      "CPSC110 is probably the hardest course amongst all CPSC courses. But Celina did her best to explain every concepts/processes in an extremely clear manner in lectures. She is inspirational, engaging, and responsible. She truly cares about students' success by holding lots of extra office hours. Highly recommend for anyone taking 110.",
      "Pretty relaxed, but she tends get mad if you try to leave early.",
      "Celina is fantastic! She knows everything about the course and pay lots of attention to students. She is pacient and respected to every students even not in her course. Really recommend.",
      "Celina is one of the BEST profs I've had at UBC. I took a condensed summer course with her and she was AMAZING. Seriously, just amazing. If you get a chance to take a course with her, DO IT!! She's so motivating and inspirational -- made me love CPSC even when it got quite challenging. Worked hard and earned a great mark!",
      "Took CPSC110 with her in a condensed summer course and I do not regret it. The course itself is a lot of work but Celina puts her students before everything else. She goes out of her way to make sure that every student in her class understands and is performing to their utmost best. Great lecturer, always happy and very respectful. 11/10 Prof.",
      "BEST PROF EVER!! She is always so enthusiastic in her lectures, she made me love comp sci even though the concepts were not easy at times. She is also very caring if you have a question and motivates you to do well. 10/10 would recommend, trust me, you won't be sorry :)",
      "Best professor I've ever had so far. She is enthusiastic about teaching and cares about the students' success.",

Group project isn't too bad + not worth that much. Actual project is worth 7.5% and the other 7.5% is peer evaluation + proposal. Course is a GPA booster. Must take with her!",

      "Great professor + genuinely took feedback to improve course. average was 81 course content isn't hard but if you're looking for more useful applications take CPSC110. online quizzes aren't hard b/c it's from the lecture notes + best 3/5 quizzes. group work - &quot;15%&quot; but more like 7.5% since you get marked on group feedback etc. would recommend her",

Coming to lecture wasn't a chore at all. Really hope she stays and teaches other courses. She's one of those profs you'll never forget.",

I never felt bored in the 1.5 hour lectures, very special.",

      "Great comp sci prof that made lectures very lighthearted and borderline fun. She even wrote a poem for us on the last class and she knows student names. However the course itself is very high workload especially for people without coding experience. Exams were fair and the course team is very caring and understanding of student struggles.",
      "Truly the pinnacle of human evolution. Can't wait for her poetry she promised to do at the end of the semester.",
      "Very nice prof, is always happy to discuss homework and concepts during office hours. The problem sets can be exceedingly difficult with a tight grading scheme, but those are graded by the TAs."

He's so insightful, and I learned more useful stuff in that class than any other CS class. Take him for high level classes for sure. And he scales up a lot too. Though he doesn't have much time to attend to students.",

Definitely saved my interest in CPSC, and 110 in general. Feel bad for those who dropped out of CPSC because of 110, and didn't get a chance to experience Ron",
      "He's the one 110 prof that really tries. Funny. Great personality. Friendly. Not the best prof ever! But definitely better that Meghan Allen! Not too much better than Gregor and Ron in terms of teaching. If you're looking for an A on this course you should keep up with all the assign. and practices online and go to office hours as much as you can.",
      "Ron is by far one of the best profs! He's hilarious and he always starts off the class with the \"Good morning\". I appreciate that because he wants us to be excited for the class. The lectures fly by really quickly. Make sure you do all the homework because it's really easy to fall behind as I am new at programming. A very interesting course!",
      "Ron is really passionate about CS and is super funny in lecture. He made a very dry programming class entertaining. The only problem is that he spends a lot of time answering questions so we never finished any modules in class. The course workload is quite brutal for those new to programming so be prepared to keep up with it.",
      "Ron is a great prof - 110 is a tough course but he did a good job communicating the subjects in lecture. VERY helpful and approachable during office hours, and really tries to learn students' names!",

      "Sometimes a little bit confusing, overall a very good prof. Tries very hard in the beginning of the semester to remember everyone's names.",
      "Very engaging and clear instructor. Even though I didn't enjoy using DrRacket, prof made it somewhat more bearable.",
      "Very creative. Super smart. Highly entertaining too. Any prof who can mix wu tang and cookie monster with recursion is definitely worth taking. You might even get a cookie out of it!",

      "Great prof, great class. They overhauled CSC309 recently and this course is amazing now. Mark has a relaxed teaching style and is pretty funny sometimes. He emphasizes coming to class, and some of the questions on the midterm are based on things he covered only in class.",
      "I had Mark last year for CSC121. I feel like he delivered the best learning experience I ever had at UofT . If you are afraid of CS courses you honestly do not need to be anymore because he teaches from a place of understanding that all students have varying levels of experience. He's admirable and truly knowledgable.",
      "He is so nice! Very clear and informative lectures! He is also very patient when answering questions.",
      "I am currently taking his csc309, I don't think this overall quality score is fair enough for him, he is a great prof and he do want students to get a high mark, if u didn't it sadly because u are bad lol",
      "People just complain about his final but the truth is it was fair and covered what was taught in the course. I did ok on it and some of my friends got close to perfect so it wasn't impossible. People who don't study just like to complain. The prof himself is good and the exam is not the only part of the course. Study!",
      "Mark is awesome! I was actually excited to go to class and learn about programming. He breaks down the difficult concepts into easy to understand pieces.",
      "Fun course! Mark is really helpful during class and helped me understand programming. Assignments are mostly fair and you can definitely do well if you put in the work.",
      "I used to get terrified by cs courses until Mark came along. The way he teaches makes the concept so much easier to understand. He is knowledgable and explains everything clearly. Exercises are closely related to lectures and labs, but the assignment could be a real torture. Tests are fair if you pay attention to the lecture. Take his class!",
      "Have to work a lot for assignments. helpful in office hours. Good course )",
      "Hummm his assignments are hard. Not too difficult for tests&amp;quizes but it is also not easy to get high marks"

      "Dr. Ahmed is amazing. She: 1) Always responds to emails promptly 2) Explains things easily with props (Keuring machine lmao) 3) Gives tips about labs 4) Makes exams identical to problem sets or in-class examples 5) Accesible after class, at office hours or you can make an appointment The only annoying thing is pop quizzes (almost every Thursday)",
      "She really wants the students to learn, and tries to think of unique ways to get her message across. She has an accent, but you can still easily understand her. She has a lot of different grading criteria, such as pop quizzes, online quizzes, and exams. The exams are not heavily weighted, which is nice. No powerpoint with notes.",
      "She's a great professor when it comes to explaining, teaching you how to think about the concepts, and how to apply the concepts properly. She really sets the bar high for professors which allows you to appreciate her class. I don't show up to a lot of classes because I feel I can learn better alone but I never missed one of her classes.",
      "She's probably my favorite professor at U of A thus far, she's a engaging lecturer who explains the sometimes obtuse concepts very, very clearly. She also is very open to helping students outside of class if they need. My only gripe with her is that it seemed like she spent a little too much time on certain concepts and rushed through others.",
      "Great t professor. She explains the material well and really wants you to succeed. Take her class if possible.",
      "She explains concepts very clearly in lecture and answers questions really well! Expectations for exams is clear and she is extremely helpful when studying. Great prof for beginners!",
      "She is my favourite teachers !! Her lecture is very useful and clear. Midterm is fair, assignments is a little challenge. She pays attention to students. Definitely recommend!!",
      "For 174, she is the best. Explains very clearly. If u are a Computing Science major, U cannot get a start better than this.",
      "Best professor I have had (yet). She does a good job at getting the tougher concepts across by using analogies. By attending all the lectures you will learn everything you need to do well in the course. The exams are pretty easy, so don't stress over them, and make sure to get online vignettes over with asap.",
      "She is very caring, and always checks in with her students during lecture to see if you understand. Explains topics thoroughly.",
      "Sadaf Ahmed is a great prof for introductory Computing Science. Really takes the time to explain the concepts and answers students questions clearly and respectfully. Lectures are a bit dry though and if you have any prior experience it's a breeze.",
      "As a student majoring in psychology, comp sci was out of my realm. The first time I attempted to fill my credits I took comp sci 101 with prof Kerolus. It was a horrible experience that made me feel like I would never complete this credit. Sadaf works hard for her students to succeed, if you are in the same situation as me DO YOUR CLASS WITH SADAF",
      "Sadaf is frankly an amazing prof. She always makes an effort to help students understand concepts in class, going fairly slow and reiterating important ideas. She is very accessible in office hours and is always very pleasant. She won't test on anything absurd, and is reasonable in her expectations for what we learned. Take 174 with her.",
      "Amazing professor, and no I'm not just saying that because I got a decent mark. I passed with a B+ but I worked for that mark. However, Sadaf is a really passionate prof who cares about her students. Visit her office for help with anything from the lab to the in-class material. Midterm and final were both fair. Easily the best prof I've had.",
      "Excellent professor. Cares about her student. Highly recommend.",
      "The best prof in u of a! Love her so much. She is nice and friendly, and she is happy to help you. Her office hour is useful as well. Her lecture is useful, so do not skip class. Anyway, i will recommend this prof to people who want to take CMPUT 174.",
      "Best professor ever!!! Lecture is very clear and useful. Make sure you go to each lecture, you will get A easily.",
      "She is one of the best professor I've had so far. The concepts are taught fairly easy to understand, whenever there is confusions, she is always willing to help as long as you ask.",
      "If you have no experiencing in coding, PICK HER! Well, pick her any way because she is by far the best professor I came across in this University. Tests are super easy if you pay the tiniest attention in the class.",
      "An amazing prof I would like to take w/ again. She clearly explains concepts as well as repeats them so students get it in their head. If students don't understand, she's willing to go over the concept however many times. Fast on emailing and is amazing in her office explaining things.",
      "Sadaf Ahmed teaches a very good introductory Computer Science course. The content of the course itself may be difficult for absolute beginners, but Sadaf is ready to help and answer any questions you may have. If you have any previous programming knowledge like I did, this class is an easy A.",
      "A very caring professor who is passionate about her work. Make sure to do practice questions for the midterm and final.",
      "I had no coding experience prior to taking this class and at first I found it tough, but Prof. Ahmed was super helpful and really helped explain the concepts well. The online videos you have to watch in the beginning are super annoying but really important to establish base knowledge. Go to class and follow along and you'll do great.",
      "Amazing Prof, a touch repetitive, but perhaps necessary in an introductory course. Very helpful and I came out feeling I learned a huge amount about programming. My only beef is her love of Comic Sans. Ugh, the font burns my eyes.",
      "Really liked prof Ahmed. Found her approachable and easy to understand. She was often repetitive with certain questions or concepts, but it definitely helped me remember things (may differ for you depending on how you learn). Had her during Fall 2015.",
      "Really great professor, definitely recommend. Make sure you understand the codes she wrote in class. Ask if you don't, she is always willing to help and explain further if you put in the effort.",
      "As a third year student , this is my first time to rate a prof because she deserves it! Chose CMPUT 174 as an optional course with no coding experience before and still got an A+.Sadaf is a FANTASTIC lady wherever in class or in office, she makes the course easy. If you show up to lecture and do the labs, you can get any score you want! CHOOSE HER!",
      "She was really nice. Made herself available the morning of the final for last minute questions which was nice. She cares about her students, often asked me how it was going and when I told her I was struggling, she checked back with me. Attending class is a good idea because she gives hints about exams but perfect attendance not required.",
      "I really like Sadaf! She really knows her stuff and makes a huge amount of effort to make sure everyone understands what she's explaining. She is really good about pointing out the most important concepts too.",
      "This professor is awesome! She is super concerned about your understanding and she is really friendly and helpful! I never learned computer science before but I made a great job in her tests. Feel free to ask questions and taking her classes are extremely important for tests! Super clarity and nice communication!",
      "Good prof, a little bit rush at the end of the class. I go class everyday, even kind of tough for me, I got better than I thought.",
      "She is an amazing prof would definitely recommend her. She's really helpful and her lectures are very clear and if you don't get something she makes the explanations easier.",
      "she is a very good prof and try her best to teach and enable you to understand.",
      "Sadaf Ahmed, simply the best prof that the University of Alberta has hired. Goes through information carefully and is extremely detailed. She ensures that students understands, helpful in class demonstrations. She literally saved my semester.",
      "Would take CMPUT classes with her again. Very good prof. clear and knowledgeable.",
      "She is funny! She will usually try to do a small review every day which is very helpful! Her lectures are so organized and awesome! She cares so much about her students and is available at any time! Wonderful prof!",
      "Great prof, makes everything crystal clear. Easy coursework and labs and a good way to learn the basics of programming (using python, which is a pretty simple language). If you've done any programming before this will probably be one of the easier courses you take in your university career.",
      "Sadaf Ahmed is the most caring, funny, and big hearted professor ever. She really makes sure you understand and is there for you if you don't. She even held out of class help sessions if you wanted extra help. She really takes teaching to the next level and defines what a good teacher is.",
      "She's a very good prof for this course and makes the all the points very clear. definitely recommended",
      "Shes a great prof, like absolutely awesome,she's obviously super passionate about computer science which is all great. The only problem is that the course is so easy at the start and moves really slow but then all the hard material is pushed till the end, make sure u dont miss any classes for her, missing one class is a lot to catch up on!",
      "Good prof, nice and approachable. Has a little trouble explaining some of the more complex concepts but shes fairly clear. Don't buy the textbook. If you go to class you should be fine. Quite interesting course overall",
      "Awesome prof., totally recommend. Clear explanations. Course is quite easy if you like programming. If you don't go to class you're screwed as the lecture slides are fairly useless. Book is useless (never even bought it and got an A).",
      "good",
      "Greatest prof ever! lots of examples, hints, things to know for exams/labs/assignments were discussed during lectures! Want a B-A? attend her lectures. take notes. Do the Labs ahead of time( lots of time given..) start early on assignments!",
      "Cheat sheets for all of the exams/quizzes, clear voice and slide, and over a week to complete each lab (she released them on Sunday so if your lab was on friday you would have 5 days to do it early and it would not be due for marking until the next lab giving you an extra week). Overall, a pretty easy class for the people who did their work.",
      "Open book exams = Easiest A+ ever. Oh, and she's actually incredibly knowledgable. Take her class if you can.",
      "You have to attend every single lecture! Depending on which lecture you miss, you can fall behind and stay behind for the rest of the semester. She makes difficult topics easy and interesting. She's really nice and is always willing to answer questions too. Exams can be tricky if you're not careful though",
      "Absolutely attend every class, it's heavily information laden. She's a wonderfully sweet professor with a big heart, trying her best to explain complex algorithms. I highly recommend making sure you understand every part of the material, ask her questions, she's very approachable and will help in any way she can.",
      "Great prof, I attended Tues and Thurs classes and they were pretty interesting. If you actually write down everything she writes and do the labs before your labs start you will have no problem getting A+. Midterms were easy and final was even easier. Open book midterms and finals made this class fun.",
      "Very helpful and Easy-to-Follow lectures. Fair exams. Highly recommended.",
      "She is just a great prof. She explains the materials very well and uses examples from our daily lives to get it into our heads. Repeats the important things we took in class in every class. Gives out her power point slides. Never used the book. Quizzes are easy but have some trick questions that must have been discussed in the class before.",
      "Sadaf is great!She made the class very easy and fun!It was worth going to her lectures and her slides are helpful.For most of the time I didn't even have to read a txtbook.She's very helpful and nice.If you pay attention in class,it will be very easy to get a good mark;)",
      "Sadaf Ahmed is a wonderful teacher. She is always willing to help and her explanations are very easy to understand. She also has a way of making potentially boring concepts interesting. There is no prior knowledge of math needed and if you attend class and do assigned readings/review lectures you\u2019ll find this class very easy.",
      "Sadaf is an excellent prof and I really liked her",
      "The material is very easy, and she has very unnoticable accent. Her exams are very easy, and she's always helpful. But I would recommend Jones' CMPUT 101 if you can get in before she leaves(summer 2k5).",
      "Sadaf is a very good teacher. She is very helpful and nice. I like her.",
      "I found her very helpful and the concepts very clear. I never noticed that she had an accent.",
      "she's good, not great.",
      "(k so im the one w/ the apple, sorry i didnt know it was so loud), but i just wanna say that this prof was excellent, and the material was easy enough if u actually studied it, but if ur not y r u there ne way&#63; totally easy to understand/almost no accent noticeable, the notes were environmentally-friendly for me[like 10pages] i recomend the course!",
      "very easy course to begin with and she furthers this with intense simplification-which can be boring at times. very nice and also helpful. the labs are also an easy component too and i recommend going to them",
      "she goes over concepts to make sure everybody understands and is really nice and helpful. kinda boring lectures tho.",
      "Teacher was helpful and showed concern for students understanding material. A very small accent that was generally easy to understand. A few errors in lecture slides however prevent a perfect score.",
      "Really easy tests; good at explaining things",
      "very friendly and helpful",
      "pretty good teacher, try to help students understand the course."

      "A really caring prof. He helps you out whenever u need it. The course itself is very hard in general though",
      "Prof likes to engage in discussions and at times goes over harder topics again to make sure the whole class is on the same page. Make time for assignments because it is very time consuming. Prof seems passionate in computer architecture.",
      "Just an caring person in general!",
      "He remembered almost all students in his class!!! Amazing prof. His labs are a little bit difficult and they are really time consuming. But the exams are not that hard since he gives you a bank of questions.",
      "The prof is awesome and the class material itself is hard. Heavy course load, but you can learn a lot from this class. Will be hard to have spare time on other classes if you know nothing about assembly. Better take fewer classes or more easy classes The GPA you get in this class is totally depend on the effort you put not which grade you are in.",
      "He is by far my favourite prof. The courses he teaches are very difficult but he actually cares if his students understand the material. While test averages are typically low he does curve. I will be taking all of the courses he teaches (though admittedly with a lighter course load).",
      "He has a very clear, understandable way of explaining concepts. You will want to read the textbook, as the subsidiary information is helpful. He's definitely the best prof to get for this class. Just study, you'll do fine. Though, I would suggest taking it AFTER 201, not concurrently. Big picture stuff helps the small details.",
      "The best prof I've ever had. However this is a very difficult class. I almost recommend taking it as a third year as that really gave me an advantage over the other students. I highly look forward taking more of his classes and he has made me love this area of computer science.",
      "Very good prof. His explanations are clear and he will answer any questions you have if you don't understand. He records all his lectures, so you don't have to worry about missing a class. The course itself is very difficult and requires lots of effort to get a good grade.",
      "He really wants to make sure you understand the material. Of course if you don't work hard you are not going to enjoy his teaching or this class.",
      "One of the best profs in Canada. Teaches real solid compiler and system knowledge. I'm not strong in system and compiler, so I suffered a lot from this course. However, I think it's WORTH taken. You will learn all you need to know about COMPUTER SCIENCE in this course. You will gain solid hands on experience on how to implement a modern compiler.",
      "Best prof ever.",
      "Really great prof, class was tough but he is an amazing lecturer",
      "One of the most caring,invested profs I have seen yet. Knew students well. Always made interesting,animated slides (but 1st draft often had errors). If you ask,he puts in the effort to help you understand. That being said, this course is nowhere near fair in workload or grading scheme. Watch for small,unimportant details that he will fail you for.",
      "Absolutely amazing prof, best lectures ever and easy exams. Highly recommended!",
      "Nelson is one of the treasures of our CS department. Always approachable, always helpful and mindful of his students. His passion for the subject matter is contagious. He does not water down the courses he teaches which results in them being hard, but perfectly doable with a solid amount of work. If you work hard, you will do well and learn a lot.",
      "Fantastic prof! It didn't seem to matter how busy he was, he dedicated time to help his students and do the best for his class. A caveat, however: the textbook isn't great, and the material in this course is very densely packed. Try to take a lighter course load if you take this class because there's only so much a great prof can do for you.",
      "Great prof! Makes an effort to know every student. I couldn't have cared less about low level systems stuff before this class, now I'm seriously considering making it my focus. I'd say he's the best prof I've had so far in my 1.5 years at U of A. I'd recommend this class to any CS student, even if you don't want to do low level stuff in your career",

      "If you are a weak student, you will suffer. If you are a good student, you will progress more. Use of animations in lectures which makes the topic easy to understand. Accent hard to understand at first, but you get used to it. Recommended if you love system stuff.",
      "There is a lot of material covered in this course, but he gives you great notes and a lot of practice problems that you should keep up with if you want to get a good grade. Don't fall behind :)",
      "He makes hard topics easy to understand. Which is very difficult. Depth in Knowledge. Complete workaholic. Typical Portuguese accent. A nice person.",
      "Dr. Amaral is friendly, and actually makes a connection with his students. He approaches topics in a variety of ways, and really ensures understanding. On top of that, the homework is worth so little as to be optional. He's a little unconventional, but easily the best prof I've had at the UofA.",
      "Great Prof. Best class I've taken, learned so much from him. Accent a little hard at first but you get use to it. He is very willing to work with and encourage students. He will try to learn your name unlike a lot of other Profs. Not a easy class though, he will make you work but you will learn so much from it. I recommend him.",
      "Excellent prof. He really puts a lot of effort into his lectures. Even with the difficult subject matter the course was very interesting. In one lecture he got students to act out a cache! He also makes a sincere effort to learn student's names and involve them in class participation. Difficult course, but he's the best prof to teach it.",
      "At first I got the odd impression that he didn't like me, but I think it's just that his tone of voice can be deceiving. In fact, he's one of the most caring and respectful profs I've ever had, but also one of the most skilled at lecturing. Take his courses!",
      "Deep knowledge and quality lectures",
      "Great prof! He expects a lot from his students but you get a lot out of the course. I learned so much from these classes! Way more then any other CS course I've ever taken. If you have the chance take a course with him. It will be a good experience. If you are a poor to average student beware. He will make you work; don't worry, it's a good thing.",
      "Challenging but very good Prof. Didn't like him at first, but he's very friendly and really challenges his students. Very good (don't expect an easy class though!)",

Listen to his advice and pay attention in class to get a good mark on the exams. Be prepared to put in quite a lot of work for assignments and labs though.",
      "Awesome!",
      "He is an amazing prof. He cares for his students and it shows in both his office hours and in class. Going to class is of great benefit as he is very good at making hard concepts seem simple. There is a decent amount of work in this class compared to other 100 level classes. If you are prepared to work you will get the mark u want.",
      "He is the most greatest prof I have ever met! You should try your best to enroll his course. He explained everything in detail and make them easy and understandable. He is a great helper too. If you have difficulty, he will try his best to help you.",
      "He's the best prof I've had so far. Lectures are interesting and he works hard to make concepts clear to students. Very approachable and entertains doubts and questions through e-mails, in office hours and even in class. My advice, 'TAKE HIS CLASS'.",

      "One of the very best professors in the dept. Osmar is very caring, respected and methodical in terms of teaching. Also, his explanations on subject topics are very clear and teaching slides are very detailed. Despite of his busy schedule he manages time to talk with his students anytime they knock him!",

      "Great prof. Was obviously passionate about teaching computing science. I am actually thinking about taking more computer science in the future. Would recommend Osmar and the course to all my friends. I hope he teaches other courses.",
      "Very good prof. He does have a significant amount of trick/ambiguous questions on exams.",
      "Great prof. Very engaging lectures and clear illustration of the principles. First two midterms were doable but last one was substantially harder. His powerpoints are crystal clear and readable on its own but class really helps to reinforce the material.",
      "Not bad prof, always focus on researching not teaching. interesting lecture, tough marker and overload assignments. If you take cmput 175, then just take 3 more course at the same semester, cuz his assignments will take 80% of your time.",
      "He is a really good prof, his lecture is clear enough to make you understand what is going on. It's vivid",
      "Very good prof. Inspirational. I didn't know what to expect but Osmar made me love computer science. He knows how to motivate students and obviously likes teaching. I recommend him and his course to any student. I hope to get him again in another course.",
      "Good prof. Teaches and explains material really well. Assignments descriptions could be a bit better, but usually you can figure out everything from the e-class forum. Tests are a bit too long and some questions can be a surprise.",
      "make the idea very clear. Good for beginner. Also very humorous.",
      "Awesome motivator. Very good with students and always available. He interrupts his work to answer our questions even when we show up unannounced to his office. Uses very simple examples to explain concepts in class & makes sure students get it. Assignments were a little unorganized and required clarifications to become feasible. Exam easy but long.",
      "There is no need for a textbook. All the material and slides are provided online. He is very attentive to the students. Very approachable.. One of the best profs I had in CS. The course has a lot of work and lab uses crappy VM machines, but recommend the course and definitely recommend the prof. I learned a lot and will use what I learned.",
      "Good Prof. One of those I will remember.",
      "Basically you have to go into the course understanding that a ton of work including group project due during Final Exams period!! Also midterm is straight code writing and is long. If you are willing to live with that, the course material is fairly useful and prof is a good lecturer.",
      "Well explained data structures and through object lessons. abstracted java to apply material to many high-level languages. available for questions out of class. friendly, easily understood. Interesting exams.",
      "Awesome teacher. Very helpful and respectful. He strives to encourage students in programming and learning new things. I like his attitude towards us. He doesn't speak at us but speaks to us. Great prof. I will continue in CS. Thanks. I hope other profs are like him.",
      "I came to this site by accident and was dismayed by the crap the previous rater wrote. I took the course 2 years ago. The course was awesome & Osmar was a fantastic teacher, very helpful. Now that I work I can appreciate he's teachings. The course load is heavy and there is a lot to learn but its content is priceless. One of the best instructors.",
      "Many topics covered in class. Not enough time for all of it. It's a course that needs constant update. Very difficult to keep-up for the teacher and for us. Heavy load but relevant and we learned a lot. Practical course for immidiate jobs. I hated all the assignments and project we had to do, but once I started working I now appreciate this course.",
      "Well organized and speaks clearly. Good prof.",

      "Great professor.",
      "Very good prof, very helpful, but speak so fast and not good for program beginner. Overall, amazing prof.",
      "I would have sold my soul to not take this class. I hate computers and have no interest in programming. No choice :( But Dr. Szafron is seriously everything an instructor should be. Helpful, respectful, will spend as much time as you need to make you understand things, will explain concepts in different ways to make sure you get it. Amazing prof!",
      "Amazing prof. Makes computing approachable. Great at rephrasing topics, drawing pictures for explanation. Labs were fun but hard, and mandatory to be with a partner. Spent a lot of time outside of lab time working on it. Prof was super quick to answer emails and online forum posts though. Super fun class, even with all the work. Tests were easy.",
      "Innovative pedagogy, entertaining class, and amazing professor. I'll miss this class.",
      "Duane Szafron was a great professor. His lecture notes were clear, and he tried some in-class programming this year (which was really helpful). He clearly showed us our marks on the two midterms right away, what we did wrong, and how to fix the mistakes. I look forward to taking more classes with him in the future if possible.",
      "Really passionate about his pedagogy and interested in making sure his students learn. The tests are pretty difficult, but they do genuinely test how well you know the material. If you have no experience with programming before this you'll probably have some trouble with the course but as long as you put in some effort you should be fine.",
      "I'm going to miss this course. That should tell you something about how awesome it is.",
      "Excellent Prof. Excellent explanations and does an example coding project at the end of classes to show how a full program comes together. Might have been useful for those with no programming experience if he had shown more code earlier in the classes but other than that no complaints. Very easy course if you have any experience writing code.",
      "Duane is a FANTASTIC professor, really one of the few that actually cares. Don't know anything about comp sci or programming&#63; Then I definitely recommend Duane. His first class he finished his rant with &quot;/rant&quot; That's an A+++ in my books. Take him",
      "Duane is great. He's very eager to help students. Course is very theory based and structured off the powerpoints, so I would say attendance is not a absolute must. Although, his explanations do make the material easier. Tests are extremely time constrained. Not mandatory but prior programming experience does help.",
      "The prof was a really nice guy and helpful but the lectures were mostly theory based in that barely any programming was done to help the students understand the concepts.The Exams were really long and no one finished since the MC had 9 options to chose from. If you have no experience with programming prior to this class then DON'T take this class!",
      "Only problem was all tests were ridiculously long. None of the students could finish on time. As for me, I understood all the material but the midterms basically tested on how fast you could write.",
      "Friendly, helpful The class is clear. Exam is not very easy. (really depends on your level)",
      "Very clear and thorough in class. He obviously cares about the students and wants them to succeed. Only complaint is that 2nd midterm was too long for the time limit; nobody was able to finish in time.",
      "Excellent professor, spoke clearly and explained the concepts well. As this was my first intro to programming, I found it best to supplement his lectures with reading the textbook. Midterms and the exam were challenging, and made you think, so that's another plus. All in all, if you've never programmed before, his course is a great intro to it.",
      "Maybe he's gone downhill since the last review because I couldn't stand the guy. Lectures were old powerpoints from another prof. filled with mistakes which he just read off of, exams were unreasonable (e.g. one was designed for students to not finish on time, multiple choice questions have up to 9 options) and so on. I wish I had the other guy.",
      "Very helpful. General concepts were explained in a manner consistent with concepts learned in later courses.",
      "Very nice professor!Just finding computer is so interesting! very kind to help students out. his lecture is very clear and well-orgenized. willing to answer questions in class and repeat quesion one more time to make every students know.",
      "Best prof in the department",
      "Probably the best teaching prof in the department. Why doesn't he teach more courses&#63;!",

      "Class is quite boring, but her notes (posted online) are fantastic. Speaks slowly and monotone, but knowledgeable. If you require a good lecture to learn, find another prof, but if you just need good notes take her class!",
      "She speaks slow but very good prof, definitely recommended.",
      "Very good prof, falls just short of what I would call a great prof. Explanations are quite good, although be sure to YouTube a lot of topics for further clarification. Not the greatest prof ever, but by no means a bad one. Recommended.",
      "Friendly prof but was sometimes disorganized (programs not working, etc). Class is quite boring and the languages taught are mostly useless. Exams were not too hard and minimal studying should pull you through no problem. Easy labs that can be done at home. Didn't even read the textbook. Decent prof and easy science credit if you need one.",
      "Seems very friendly, although I never actually went to talk to her after class. Her explanations were clear, but she didn't always seem completely prepared (a program did not work, so we spent most of class correcting it) All in all a good prof though :)",
      "She is the Martha Stewart of algorithms! Wonderful prof. Very nice and helpful. Writes clear and useful notes in class that closely follow the textbook; exams and assignments based directly on the notes. Marking is very fair and she will go over exams and give back marks if there was a mistake. Tough final but still fair. Taken: Winter 2011.",
      "Excellent presentation of the material. Assignments covered the material well and were easy to complete if started early. Later exams evaluated competence instead of rote memorization, which is simply outstanding. Highly recommended.",
      "fair reasonable professor",
      "She was a great prof. She made the concepts in 304 seem easy! A wonderful prof! The lectures were enjoyable to go to (that's saying a lot for a theory course:) )!",

Make sure you attend class because he has almost daily quizzes which are free marks if you attend. Also for the project be very mindful of the rubric, not a lot of the marks are for the actual code.",
      "While he claim he wont post soltuion for sample exam, you can found them easily by visiting the forum and see his feedback on others sample exam. He should get some TA to do the exam first, there are some obvious mistakes in the final exam. He also allow you to bring 4 page of double side sheet to final exam, so easy A if prepare well.",
      "This professor gives a lot of materials(Both videos and text notes) for studying.",
      "Best prof I've ever had. Not sure where the last person was coming from as he gave practice midterms and finals as well as extensive notes, supplementary youtube videos and was very responsive to any questions asked on the forum or directly. Overall he cares a lot about his subject matter and really seems to want students to succeed. A++ prof.",
      "Easiest professor in the department. GPA booster. 100% recommended!",
      "I highly respect Prof Hindle. It seems to me that he really takes his job seriously and he really wants students to get the material he is delivering. He does a great job of teaching.",
      "My best advice for people taking Hindle's 301 is to make sure you know a little bit of Android and Java before the term begins. This is a class that heavily favours students who have such previous knowledge and who also have a close, competent group of friends to work on the project in a buttery smooth manner. If else, the project is hell.",
      "Most approachable, knowledgeable CS prof at UofA. Knows a little bit of everything with decent depth. Great, great guy, amazing lecturer. Quizzes are for participation only & he sees what class knows. Project is tough but amazing learning. Start early, get a good group. Labs could be improved. Range of grades is small: 86% B, 95% A, midterm matters",
      "Great professor. He cares about the course and making sure everybody understands the material. Midterm and final are good and easy to prepare for with study sheets and practice problems. There's a project that you need to do in groups of 5, but as long as you follow the rubric and put time and effort into it it's an easy 40% of your total mark.",
      "What a great guy. He clearly understands the course material and how to teach it. Midterm and final had clear requirements and closely followed the practice problems. A large portion of the course is a group project which is great for learning software engineering and team work.",
      "I really enjoyed Hindle's teaching. Notes are straightforward, cheat sheets allowed in exams, and they follow the same format as practice. The course material itself is not difficult. The project takes up a lot of your time and effort. Although his face is serious at first, he will start to smile and be more approachable the more you talk to him",
      "Abram does his best to make his lectures exciting. He takes daily quizzes so you can not skip. My only complaint is his marking rubric is flawed for project. Only 15% of your marks is determined from program you write. Unit tests, documentation, UML diagram, ect takes the rest of grades. Don't bother refining program, just follow rubric.",
      "Abram is a good lecturer and a fair tester/marker. The project pretty much killed me, but it pretty much does that to everyone. Keeps the lectures interesting by inserting jokes. Check out \"scruntscrunt\" while you are at it.",
      "Great course! Very crystal clear about discussing web based technologies. Introduced concepts of websockets, REST, HTTP basics, webmining, ajax, very clearly and succinctly. Work is reasonably challenging and informative.",
      "Great prof. Learned a lot of very useful software development skills.",
      "Very knowledgeable professor, always available for Q&A at the end of his lectures and during office hours. His assignments were interesting and taught you the latest in web development.",
      "great professor =)",
      "Abram is a great prof. He teaches practical development techniques that you can apply in the real world. He was always willing to help and prompt to reply emails. Course was a bit dry, but he encouraged attendance by having daily \"quizzes\" (not marked; for participation). Android development part was also great fun if you have a good team."

While attending class is not mandatory, you'll find it A LOT easier to understand stuff by listening to her lectures than learning it on your own - but that is not to say it is impossible to catch up if you miss a day or two.",
      "She explains concepts slowly and clearly with concrete examples. She seems to really care about her class learning the material. The tests are quite a bit more difficult that the labs and assignments, but are graded fairly. Clear and well explained feedback is given on the assignments and tests. Over all, great Prof.",
      "This class was AMAZING. If you are interested at all in computing science but don't have any experience coding, this is the class to take, and this is the prof to take it with. It's definitely challenging, especially if your like me and have never coded before, but totally worth it if you are into it.",
      "Clear speaker, fairly interesting, willing to help. Class was graded on a midterm, a final, 3 assignments and a weekly lab. Only complaint: no solutions were posted for practice exams and problems. Don't skip class after the midterm. Free access to an online textbook (which is also optional).",

She was also available and very helpful outside of class for questions.",

Everything gets covered from every angle, and overall the course was a great follow-up to CMPUT 174. I didn't realise there were bonus points for using iClicker, which is a bit odd... Overall, fantastic prof.",
      "the course itself is not an easy one, at least for me, so it may not be a GPA booster even it is taught by Jacqueline who barely fail students(btw she is clear&helpful). attendance is not mandatory but you can get 4 bonus marks by achieving over 90% of iclicker questions participation. paperbook is recommended even there is free access to e-version",
      "Good prof, clear speaker. She knew what she was talking about and clearly made an effort to keep the coursework interesting!",
      "Overall a good prof! Everything you need to know is in the class notes. Labs are helpful and assignments are fun. Marked kinda easy on exams. Good explanations and was always available and happy to help/answer questions. Anyone with a bad review obviously did poorly in class or is new to university and doesn't get how it works. Highly recommended!",
      "she is very helpful and very generous in marking exam. I think she is is more like a friend but the content in class goes to fast which can cause confusion.",

Only concepts that were taught in class were in the tests. The course itself might be a little scary at first but I think its designed so we grasp programming and python in the end.",
      "His lectures are aimed towards people who had no prior experience in programming. It can be boring at times, but it is really thorough. I highly recommend that you code along with him, and try to interact with him. He's really nice.",
      "Lectures consist of watching him write code for a game. I did not know any programming before his class, and I feel like I learned a lot. He really tries to make sure people understand. The midterm and final were really easy if you understand the basic. He has a slight accent, but he is easy to understand.",
      "He's a good lecturer but the course design itself seems flawed. If you have no coding experience the first few weeks are going to be very difficult, as he lectures as though you have a coding background. Then in the latter half of the course, the course becomes boring and repetitive with little new content.",
      "He is an amazing choice of professor. Open to any questions during class time and will explain it in a way that everyone understands. His midterm was very straightforward, he said he was going to make the final harder but it felt easier. There wasn't a single trick question. Every method to getting a solution of his tests were introduced in class.",
      "He is very caring and nice. He goes through everything slowly, and always makes sure that everyone understand everything before moving one new stuff. As long as you understand the materials, you will do fine on the midterm and final, which are based on what you learned in class, no trick questions.",
      "Excellent prof, I learned a lot from his lectures. I did not have prior programming experience but his explanations were so clear and detailed that I was fine. The hard part of this course (and other CS courses in my opinion) is the labs. I would recommend working on them in advance and seeking help when you need it.",
      "A gifted lecturer. Articulate and clear in his explanations of concepts. He answers questions on the discussion forum in a incredibly timely manner. I have not been to his office hours, so I can not speak for how he is one-to-one. Overall, he imparted in me a curiosity to continue my education in databases. So, that gets 5 stars from me.",
      "Joerg is a fantastic professor. His lectures are clear and if you attend and pay attention the material of this course will come easy. Overall this was a very easy course. One of the best things about Joerg is how quickly he answered the forum when anyone had questions. His exams are fair and the projects are reasonable. Just start them early.",
      "The best computer science class prof ever, class is easy and there is no quiz on this class, only 2 easy assignments and 1 group project. the project is similar as past years, and the midterm is not hard if you review his sample for midterms. He really nice to explain the questions for students and the grade is easy.",
      "He explains really well, is careful to answer your actual questions and not what he THOUGHT was your question, very friendly, and an overall wonderful prof. Plus CMPUT 174 is the BEST intro class to computing science at the UofA, especially with him.",
      "He's a very good teacher and a funny guy, but he can get off on tangents every so often, usually by drastically over explaining any questions asked. His notes are a bit hard to read so go in ready to take your own or learn from the textbook/labs. No complaints other than that, the class was plenty of fun.",
      "Very good professor. His class was cool and relaxing.Download and print his notes, then all you have to do is sit and listen to what he is saying. Maybe add a few lines to his notes. I loved doing the assignments as well."

      "Took in 2017. Or is incredibly strict and very intelligent. He doesn't have patience for students that do not want to achieve their best. I once asked him why he teaches 204 like a graduate class and he responded with, &quot;Thank you.&quot; He allowed any amount of time for the final (I took 5 hrs). There was PhD candidacy level questions on one assignment.",
      "Had him for 204, now 304. Assignments are not as hard as 204, quizzes are trivial and lectures are mostly clear. Does require strong math backgrounds though (e.g. math 117/127) to do well. Would recommend if you like algorithms and problem solving.",
      "Extremely passionate and easy to understand",
      "Amazing prof that gives out very difficult homework assignments. He does give some extra credit stuff, and the final is a blessing - I raised my mark from failing to a C+ because of the final. His homework is very difficult, but I think I came out with an amazing understanding of the material because of it.",
      "Many people tended to complain about him b/c he expects a lot out of the students. Tends to go through content quickly through slides and does not like laptops in class (print out your notes). Went into far more detail than required for the course (b/c he saw the significance in the course), expected you to know a lot from prerequisites.",
      "CMPUT 204 isn't the easiest course to take. The difficulty of homework given is on par with Honours Math (or even higher), however the end result if totally worth it. Attendeance to lectures is highly recommended though not mandatory. Or goes through a lot of examples/proofs/analysis of algorithms discussed. To anyone: Do Math 117 before CMPUT204",
      "Or is an amazing prof. His assignments are challenging and take several hours to really understand each question. He's approachable and usually pretty helpful when asking questions. The class was insanely difficult so attendance is a must, reading the textbook to clear up any confusion is also helpful! Pay attention and stay off your phone to pass!",
      "Or is probably hated by a lot of people in class because of how difficult his course was. All I can say is he is brilliant. Makes you really work, and if you do put in the effort in doing the assignments (which is worth 50% in total, and averages around 50-60%), you can easily do the final with minimal preparation.",
      "Amazing prof. Very difficult concepts that were explained brilliantly. Very difficult assignments, highly recommend starting early on them. Midterm was harder than the final.",
      "Definitely was a struggle at the beginning, but once you start to understand his expectations, it gets better. Assignments were really difficult but it balanced out in the end with a decent midterm and final. The trick is to try to do as well on the assignments as possible because most of his exam questions will be something that you've seen before",
      "He's definitely not the easiest prof in the department, however he really challenges your thinking and provides ample opportunity for you to ask questions during class and he's always willing to clarify things. Assignments are fairly tough, midterm was okay and final was easy. He uses questions from assignments on exams so study them well.",
      "I wasn't sure algos was a class for me but I have to say the prof makes it really accessible. So far the lectures have been engaging and well prepared. He really emphasized you should reach out to him if you have questions or misunderstandins so I plan on showing up to office hours a lot."

      "Decent prof, but extremely unprofessional.

His lectures were easy to follow and he kept them interesting with jokes (if he was awake). He was really good at helping people as well, he could usually understand the problem right away, and help you by directing you to the answer. Awesome guy",

      "Dr. Bowling was extremely helpful in quickly understanding people's questions and helping them to understand the concept, instead of just giving them the answer. The main problem that I had was with the course layout. I found the course to be \"sink or swim\" due to the fast pace. I had no prior programming experience, so I found the course hard.",
      "Great professor; probably one of the best on campus. He gives amusing lectures, involves the class, and marks fairly while still challenging students to improve and do their best.",
      "Attendance not mandatory to class but was helpful in labs. Textbook reinforced understanding. If you want to do well, you will. Professor was helpful and prepared you for exams.",
      "Seems like he really knows what he is talking about, but the class was so dumbed down and slow moving, it was impossible to pay attention. I don't know if that is a reflection of the content or the prof. I went to maybe 5 classes all term and had no trouble with any of the material. Everything about this class was just so easy.",

      "This professor was great. He answered all my questions, clearly and quickly until I understood. When the class said it was difficult to follow well and copy notes, he brought a copy of the notes for everyone before class (didn't use them but good reference). I definitely recommend him, as any other 204 prof may hurt your GPA.",
      "great prof. makes the class fun.",
      "His teaching style concentrates on process. He won't give you the theorem; he'll give you a problem, then help you generalize it. This is important in a class like 204 because you learn to solve things by yourself. ~Higher class average in 204.",
      "As a person he's pretty good and easy to deal with, but as a professor, he's not very good. He's very personable and approachable, but not very rigorous or formal in the way he teaches, which makes it difficult when it comes to assignments and exams."

Perfectly clear in examples and very easy to follow. Exams were a bit tough as they required a lot of careful thought and understanding. If you're good at computing already you'll do really well.",

      "Paul is really a great guy. His classes are really fun. He's always enthusiastic about teaching, very responsive in MyCourses and really cares about his students and he makes sure that the students understand the material and helps them in their assignments He usually gives 4 assignments which are time-consuming but fun and easy to overcome.",
      "Nice fella.",
      "I still don't understand cache at all or anything that was covered in lectures after that yet I still got an A. I might have no deserved it but I think it's awesome generosity! 5 stars just for that",
      "Awesome prof and interesting material in my opinion! He made class fun by sometimes playing short film clips or sounds from movies to introduce the next topic. When it came time to study for the final, it was genuinely fun to study since most of the topics were well explained and still clear in my head.",
      "Fantastic lectures; concepts were explained pretty well. Assignments were tough but at the same time interesting to do. Midterm and final were fair; with proper amount of studying you will ace both of them.",
      "Very inspirational prof and amazing lecture content (recommended for all mathematically oriented computer scientists but not only). Paul was very helpful throughout the course, with assignments but also with extra-curricular issues",
      "Great guy and fun lectures",
      "Very nice professor.",
      "Probably the best/clearest comp sci prof I have taken here at Mcgill. Paul Kry does a great job at demystifying computers. He is a great lecturer and explained everything in a fun and simple way. The assignments are pretty heavy though, really not the type of assignments you can do last minute. I would definitely take another class with him again!",
      "The easiest course of my semester--just keep up with slides, going to the TB if you have to, and show up to the exam. Assignments were really well-written; they were challenging but fun! Would definitely want to take an upper-year course with him. Amazing lecturer/public speaker and actually keeps you engaged during class. All around cool guy!",
      "Best Prof ever. Def want to take a course with him again. &lt;3",
      "One of the best professors at McGill. Very understanding.",
      "No other prof I'd take this course with.",
      "One of my favorite professors yet! You can see that he is passionate about CS and he cares. Really enjoyed 273 with him and hope to take one of his higher-level classes.",
      "One of the best, if not the best, prof in CS. Lectures with genuine enthusiasm and enjoys making references to 80s sci-fi movies. Clear slides, and he really seems to care about his students doing well. (assignments are challenging but reasonable)",
      "Prof Kry is great guy! I am not a fan of the course content, however Paul still makes his lectures interesting. 5.0 quality no doubt!.",
      "Great Prof, its understandable that the course material is hard. Def want to take a course with him in the future.",
      "The structure of the course is very well organized. He comes well prepared and you can tell how much work he puts into his slides. If you want to take a course that teaches you PLENTY, and is lead by someone with a good sense structure take Paul Kry. He did a great job at teaching the course. Assignments are hard, but you will learn a lot.",
      "Is he an amazing professor? Meh maybe. Is he a good professor? Absolutely. He is mentally present when lecturing and not going through the motions of reading slides. He believes you learn by doing and i have to agree with him. I learnt the most by writing assembly code on my own. I would suggest taking him if you have a passion for the subject.",
      "His explanations are very clear. Before taking his class, I thought the way a computer was built was the most boring subject I'll have to learn about in my program, but now it actually became what I love the most and look forward to learning about in the next years. Truly an awesome professor, would take again :) (assignments are kind of hard tho)",
      "Brilliant professor that help so much in office hour.",
      "Nice professor. He is funny. Assignments are hard but they are really helpful for us to understand the course content.",
      "Kry's a good professor. I enjoyed going to class at first because of his charisma and enthusiasm toward the material. However, as the semester went on I found his lectures to be increasingly unstructured; reading the textbook was better for learning. Assignments were hard but doable, really helped me understand assembly language &amp; logic more deeply",
      "great prof, very funny, captivating lectures",
      "Really good professor. His lecture makes sense and his slides are clear. He is a humour guy. 4 assignments are hard but interesting, and they are not very helpful to exam. But doing assignment is a good way to understand the circuit and mips. Midterm is fair and average is about 82%. If you review all the slides, A won't be difficult.",
      "The homework was really easy to finish but hard to achieve the first place. Sometimes the first place of an assignment is awarded, so probably you wish to work hard to win the prize. But if you just want an easy A you can skip many classes just like me. And it takes not too long to get bonus points so I consider the prof really merciful.",
      "4 Assignments can be hard, but it's only a matter of time. Truly brilliant professor, although he proceeds quite fast in class that a lot of us might not catch up. It's still easy to read his well prepared ppt to get to know everything u might need in exams. Exams are not challenging as long as you behave actively in class.",
      "Assignments could be time consuming and a pain in the brain, but at least there are only four assignments",
      "Not so difficult, just normal. The assignment are interesting, and the difficult is suitable. If having course recording would be better. By the way, the professor is very patient to answer the questions.",
      "Has a good sense of humor, goes over the material step by step at a steady pace. Lectures are not recorded and age in the afternoon but the slides and suggested readings of textbook are posted on mycourses.",
      "Long assignments but very fair grading scheme",
      "Very fun prof who knows his stuff and teaches well. Would recommend 100%. Might be hard for non comp sci majors?",
      "Truly cares about students' concerns and promptly answers questions on the discussion section of myCourses. Lectures may be a bit confusing for those who haven't learned some jargon, but he goes through many examples in class. And also remember: &quot;what did we do last class?&quot;",
      "He is really nice .. the assignments are kind of time-consuming but they are interesting",
      "Very entertaining prof, does lots of examples in class, brings interesting facts and stories in class (that were usually related to the material). Very helpful when answering questions. Knows the material very well. Definitely the most epic last lecture I've seen in four years at McGill.",
      "Don't expect the class to be easy - COMP273 is complicated and if you don't do well it's not because of the Professor; Prof. Kry makes you work pretty hard and creates all the conditions for you to succeed but you need to really understand all the important stuff the computers are built from.",
      "A great experience all around. Readily available to answer questions and course material presented clearly with strong reinforcement from relevant assignments. Tests and assignments presented fairly and graded in a timely fashion.",
      "Great teacher, but you need to read on your own to fully understand what he explains in class.",
      "He made the class very enjoyable and interesting. Assignments, midterm and final were very fair content and time-wise. Very accessible and always tries his best to answer questions. He really cares and made this class the best one I've had this semester. No other prof I'd rather take this class with!",
      "He's great! Assignments are a little tough, but when you are done you realize they were very fair. Very fun lecturer and will slow down to the pace of the class and wants everyone to understand! Great professor and great class, would take him again!",
      "Prof. Kry is great! Really nice, works hard to make sure you understand the material. Assignments were fair, and shorter than many others I've done in CS at McGill. Definitely agree with the guy who said he's the Bob Ross of CS.",
      "Paul Kry isn't the easiest Prof at McGill, but if you're going into computer science you should probably have expected that. He really cares about his students, and he's pretty funny in lectures, enough to keep the class involved. Paul offers the kind of insight you can't just find on Stack Overflow, take his class and you'll be happy for it.",
      "I thought Prof. Kry did a good job. He really knows the material and the assignments work well to integrate the course material with what he's passionate about. Exams and assignments are marked quite fairly. He does a good job engaging the class during lectures when the material could be a bit dry.",
      "I took this class and literally don't understand the amount of shade he's getting. I never went to class cuz the lectures were recorded, and using just those I was able to get an A- overall. He uses a different approach in lectures, trying to engage the class by interactively working through questions, some use it as an excuse to say he's confusing",
      "This class with Kry is my favourite comp sci course within the program. The assignments were interesting but not hard and he made them worth half the overall grade, so when it came to finals, there was literally no stress. I barely went to class, but I didn't need to cuz all the information I needed, I could extract from the slides.",
      "He's kinda like if Bob Ross taught you Comp Sci. He has an afro too. This course if pretty hard and can get boring, but that's not his fault. He's not THAT good at explaining things but he's alright, and friendly enough to help.",
      "Course material was boring but that's not his fault",
      "Boring class. Just used the textbook",
      "The assignments are pretty great/interesting but take way too long in my opinion. I probably would have done better in this class if I went more often. Also I would have went more if he did more example questions in class cause that's what I really needed tbh. Overall, not that bad. He posts a lot on the discussion boards which is nice.",
      "I don't know what the fuss was with the other reviews. My friends and I found this course kind of dense, but the prof was super clear and the exam was pretty alright too.",
      "Prof Kry is always genuinely passionate in class. This semester a lot of people decided to skip so they might not have done as well since he does great examples on the board. In general the course material does take time to understand, but the assignments were fair and interesting and the final was similarly very fair. He also is very helpful. 5/5!",
      "People are harsh here because this is a hard class. You really have to work for your grade in this class, and that's not all about the prof, its cause it's not easy content. Prof. Kry is clear and very helpful if you ask, he always posts on the discussion boards and answers questions quickly. Make sure you pay attention in class and you'll do fine.",
      "Learnt a lot about graphics and practiced a lot. Prof. always answers questions on discussion board which is very nice and helpful Super smart and good at his field. Awesome sample code. Not easy to understand his lecture(maybe cuz I'm not a native speaker?) But the course is definitely worth taking. You will really learn something.",
      "Very engaging lecturer. He clearly cares a lot about the subject and it shows. Its also fairly obvious that he has a graphics background as he managed to focus some of the assignments on it. The assignments were time consuming but fair and were usually solved for you in the textbook. Highly recommend.",
      "Awesome.",
      "Good teacher. He really knows his stuff and is young and energetic. Be sure to ask questions when things are unclear he has a bad habit of not finishing his sentences."

      "Only take this course with him. Guaranteed A if you study regularly",
      "I really didn't know what's going and still got A-, that's some great generosity",
      "Prakash is great, he explains concepts clearly in an easy to understand way. The additional notes on his website are well written and very helpful. The expectations for assignments and exams are precisely given which makes them easy to do if you put some work into understanding the concepts. All classes I took with him were amazing experiences",
      "I actually struggled with the material in this class before the final (Midterm, Quizzes, Assignments), so I was quite worried about how I would do in the class. But the final ended up being an absolute joke as Prakash had already more or less told us what would be on it and he had also prepared was really well. An absolute gem.",
      "Emphasizes concepts and thinking rather than memorization. Some test questions are designed to be solved by one line of creative code rather than 20 minutes of hand-cramping writing. Homework is the same way: once you get it, it's really quick (and satisfying) to type for a minute or two and then watch everything just work. Great prof.",
      "Prakash is the best. He is very clear in lecture. He is very humours. He provides fantastic notes on his website which is very useful. Assignments are not hard and they are very fun! Midterm is fair and the average is around 75, which is rare in 3-level comp courses. I would definitely wish to take any other comp courses with him again.",
      "He is not decidable as well as coCE during office hours.",
      "Best CS prof I've had at McGill. Lectures are extremely clear and concise, and Prakash really cares about his students doing well. He has stayed well past his office hours to help students in the past.",
      "Very clear and efficient at teaching. It took me some time to fully understand recursion, but after I got it, it was really easy. IT'S JUST BLACK MAGIC! Final class average should be at least B+",
      "He really has the right way to teach. His presentation of the material is simply efficient. I could understand everything the first time. The assignments and exams implied more thinking than actual writing and were sometimes challenging, but always rewarding.",
      "Legit wizard. People find comp 302 hard because it's quite foreign but Prakash is a wizard at teaching this stuff. Going to his class was an actual treat, I'll take any class that he's teaching. About half the class was done the final within an hour.",

      "A great lecturer, passionate with what he's teaching. Really funny.",
      "Great lectures, very clear and consist. However, go see the TAs if you have a question unless you are absolutely stuck. If you ask him a question because you're confused get ready for a verbal thrashing.",
      "Loved this course. Prakash does a great job giving the material life through his dedication to getting the information across. Assignments were fair, took some work, but they were quite interesting and indicative of what to expect on tests. One thingtrusting my interest in the course, I barely studied for the final and lost a letter grade for it.",
      "Amazing prof, really cares about his students. Posts very detailed notes online to make sure everybody understands. Lectures are entertaining and funny. Assignments are very interesting. Exams are fair and the exam material is explicitly laid out beforehand. He puts emphasis on the exactness of communications to avoid any ambiguity.",
      "What a wonderful professor and wonderful course. He clearly tells you exactly what will be on the midtermfinal, emphasizes the most important info in class, and is a very fun prof. He tries his best to learn everyone's name too. I absolutely loved this class. Avg midtermfinal grades were high as well.",
      "Great professor. Easy assignments and exams. Required very little studying, but was still very interesting. Would highly recommend.",
      "Amazing inspirational dude. Hilarious guy who loves music as well as getting his students to actually learn and understand instead of just dragging you through the material. Any class with him is a pleasure to take.",
      "Prakash is the best professor I've had at McGill so far. He is an amazing lecturer and I actually liked going to his office hours. What I love about him is that he gives you both material that will really push you and make you work but also is very fair, though not easy, in terms of the material he tests.",
      "Great prof. Super clear and explains everything really well. It's an awesome course. The assignments are great. I'd recommend not only this course but any course you can take with him.",
      "Prakash is legendary. Super clear explanations, fun lectures, the best office hours of all time. The material is tough, but he will give you all the tools you need to get an A.",
      "Prakash is an amazing teacher. He really cares about his students, and he always makes himself available. He uses very precise language so there is no room for confusion. He is definitely hard though, don't expect an easy A.",
      "One of the best profs at mcgill, and a really good person.",
      "He seems intimidating when you first meet him, but he really knows his stuff and is extremely invested in his students. Put in the effort to know him and work hard and you will not be sorry!",

      "Great guy.",
      "Great prof. He is crystal clear and fun to talk to. He is easily reached during office hours and has a passion for the field he teaches.",
      "Amazing prof. One of the best I've had so far. Just make sure you come to every single class cuz he'll remember if u missed any.",
      "I can totally get why some of the comments say he expects much from you cause he does make you regret ever asking a question cause he responds almost as if trying to make you feel stupid infront of the whole class HOWEVER he is SUCH a good professor in terms of lecturer and being clear and making things really really interesting.",
      "One of the best lecturers in the CS department, and a very smart prof (with a sense of humour!). He is also very helpful in his office hours and a fair grader. However, word of advice, show up to all his classes, sit in front, and pay attention. If you slack off and skip you will get on his bad side, and you do not want that.",
      "He's the best lecturer I've ever had, but he plays favorites and generally expects a lot out of his students. His emotional side is great when it comes out in the form of enthusiasm or passion for the subject in class, but unless you're a favorite you won't feel very welcome nor helped if you approach him (how dare you) outside of class.",
      "Good teacher. Very helpfull outside class. But he has a special temper... He is very frank (especially if you are not that serious) - which is good sometimes - but unfortunately sometimes gets his own conclusions too quickly. But I don't blame him, he is kind.",
      "Great teacher and very helpful outside of class.",
      "Prakash is always clear and precise, and gives excelent lectures. If he likes you, he will find a way to help you and give you a good grade. If he doesn't like you, he will find a way to give you a bad grade. Get on his good side!",

      "Great slides and a very fair final exam. No midterm, only bi-weekly online quizzes and 4 assignments throughout the semester. Only thing is he can be a bit condescending when people ask questions...",

      "Best professor that I've ever met at McGill. Fantastics lecture slides and interesting lectures. He could even made the assignments fun to us. He is very generous on curving, although this course is an easy A for me.",
      "His lecture notes are very insightful and well structured",
      "Michael Langer is by far the best prof I have ever had in McGill. He really cares his students and would do everything to make his course fair for all. He is a good lecturer and explains things very clear. He is also very approachable outside of class. He has his own course webpage that has detailed for every single lecture. He is the man.",
      "Really incredible Prof, Langer really cares for his students and it shows in the amount of effort he puts in to his slides/notes and exercises. He wants people to learn the material and is pretty funny. Really fair assignments, really fair quizzes. Overall recommend.",
      "This year had about 600 students enrolled in Comp 250 which is much more than usual. It would take ages for the TA's to grade all the work manually and the multiple choice exam is mathematically fair when you consider probability of picking right answer by luck. Langer's and his TA's are overwhelmed by the huge quantity of students.",
      "Prof Langer is amazing! The lectures are very organized and easy to follow. He keeps incredibly detailed lecture notes and presentations on his website and his assignments are very fair as long as you follow the instructions carefully. He will even sometimes let you to resubmit assignments for a higher grade if you messed up the first time.",
      "Absolutely love this class. I went to every lecture and this is what got me my good grade. Very clear presentations and explanations. Gives extra exercises to practice outside of class.",
      "Langer is an amazing prof and genuily cares for his students. He posts incredibly detailed lecture notes and slides and presents the material in a really approachable way. Lots of the bad grades people recieved here were from ignoring key instuctions on the assignments. If you follow the instructions clearly you will do well!",
      "Crystal clear teaching and occasionally good sense of humor",
      "Very organized and clear teaching style. Relevant excercises are posted. Occasionally professor Langer wil do something funny which is great. He promotes students to ask questions to clarify concepts and is also helpful at office hours.",
      "Lectures and notes are organized. It is evident that Professor Langer puts effort into teaching, helping students, and answer questions. His teaching is crystal clear which is great. Quizzes and assignments are fair and there are even office hours dedicated for assignments. Sometimes he also shows humor which is cool.",
      "Very organized, accessible and caring. Clear expectations, optimal challenges, timely and informative feedback.",
      "Two years later still one of the best profs in computer science I've ever had. If you have the chance to take his class, do it!",
      "Amazing professor, clear and simple slides. Exercises prepare you very well for the midterms(2) which are fairly easy. Assignments can be a bit hard towards the end if you are not really experienced with Java but they are definitely doable. Final was a bit hard but totally fair. Would take again!",
      "A great professor, his lectures can be slow at times but they are concise and very clear, plus his notes and exercises are a godsend that really help you understand the material. Assignments were fair but grading was very strict. Midterms were easy and final was somewhat tricky, overall if you do all the assignments and study properly you're set.",
      "A great professor whose lectures as the most efficient and economical ones I've ever listened to. If you're confused, he provides a number of really good resources to help. There's no reason you shouldn't get something in his class as long as you're willing to try.",

      "One of the best! Clearly structured lectures with amazing notes. Prepares us well by giving exercises that are similar to the questions on exams, so take the time to do them all. Everything we need to succeed is accessible online on the course page. Assignments take some time to figure out, but are very reasonable. Overall an amazing professor.",

He also provides extra notes and exercises on his website. Srsly, I'm down to take any class this man teaches!",
      "One of the best profs I've taken at McGill. Lectures are recorded so not many people show up, but don't let that fool you into thinking he's not good. He posts notes to go along with each lecture which really helps clarify key points. Gives practice exercises which definitely helped prep me for tests. Super organized, and really cares. Great prof.",

      "Honestly my favorite comp prof so far (to be fair I've only had 6 total). Very clear and fair, clearly cares about his students. Very honest and responsive to MyCourses discussions. I found him funny, he seems to have a bit of a dry wit about him. Great course, great guy, fair grader, and willing to listen and help. Lectures were a bit long.",
      "This man clearly puts a lot of time into teaching and it really shows. Very clear and easy to understand lectures, and plenty of resources and exercises with solutions. One of the top professors at McGill.",
      "Amazing lecturer, understands students and really tries to explain the concepts and their subtle details clearly. Assignments and midterm were decent but the final was devastating. The course covers a ton of material and the final goes quite deep into a bunch of different topics. Don't take this if you're looking for an easy grad lvl course.",
      "One of the best profs I had at McGill! He's an amazing lecturer and his notes are very clear. He answered every question on the discussion board (even on the days of the exams) and uploads lecture recordings. Gave us an easy midterm but the final was pretty hard. Exams are within the scope of the course but you need to understand the concepts well.",
      "Great professor! If you go to him for a doubt, he'll go out of his way to help you. Lectures and the course are really interesting. The class really jumps in the last month. It gets pretty hard towards the end.",
      "Instead of introducing an algorithm and the problem it solves in plain English, Michael dives into math notation. His background in math really shows. So sometimes it's better to learn from the internet than Michael's lectures. His midterms were easy-medium, but his final was brutal. A lot of people were swearing about it afterwards, pretty funny.",
      "Great prof. Knows his material, is a great teacher and is very active on discussion boards and resolves issues quickly.",
      "Langer is an amazing prof and a great guy. I HIGHLY recommend taking his algorithm courses. He really knows how to explain things at the right pace. His notes are great and he offers LOTS of resources which is greatly appreciated. He posts exercises for every section and is very present on the message boards.",
      "Langer should be teaching a more programming course, rather than this one. Sometimes, he seemed really rude on the discussion board. The course overall was super easy. Just be updated on what the class is taking and make sure you understand it. Exams were straight from the notes, so you could easily ace them. TAs were ridiculous in marking the HWs.",
      "he gets annoyed when people ask questions but posts all his lectures online with notes. i had trouble with the final from his notes so make sure you pay attention and keep up all semester",
      "Fantastic teacher. Clear, well paced, and considerate. Listen to him and you will succeed.",
      "Amazing. He really wants you to understand what's going on; and will take all the time it takes before moving on. No textbook: he writes his own lecture notes, which are extremely concise and clear. No need to even take note in class; just sit back and enjoy learning!!!",
      "Langer was one of the best profs I ever encountered. He's extremely helpful and the assignments made the point clearer. The quizzes were pretty straight forward, if you knew what you're doing. Final was easy as well and similar to quizzes and exercises. He tries to remember everyone's name, which makes him more friendly. Extremely recommended!",
      "Prof. Langer is admittedly not a Java programmer, but he certainly tries and he knows his stuff in that regard well enough to teach a class on it. The class is also more about theoretical computer science, which he is extremely well-versed in. Very friendly and helpful if you go and talk to him. His homeworks are straightforward. Good prof.",
      "Good prof overall, takes perhaps a bit too much time over simple examples",
      "Langer is the man. Posts all his notes and answers all your questions. Rocks the v neck and white tee all day every day.",
      "One of the best teachers I've ever had. Very knowledgeable, enthusiastic and designs challenging assignments for graphics/vision courses, that will build you up as a researcher. Also he is a terrific thesis supervisor. You will learn a lot from him! He also has a great signal processing background.",
      "very clear. Very good printed class notes -&gt; so good you need not worry if you miss class. One of McGill's finest.",
      "Top end teacher.",
      "His notes and lectures are useful and interesting. By themselves however, they are useless.",
      "Most approacheable teacher in SOCS. Notes for the class are very clear and presented in an easy to read manner.",
      "Langer is a credit to McGill. He's smart, motivated, and actually tries to communicate some understanding to students.",
      "Absolutely great teacher, very friendly and helpful.",
      "No Comments",
      "Leads students to think during class and presents the ABUNDANT material interestingly.",
      "A truly excellent teacher. His lectures have something for everybody to think about and learn from."

      "Loved the lecture content. Prof is funny, accessible and lectures are very easy to follow and understand.",
      "Great Teacher, interesting and humorous lectures. Knows when it's time to speed up the class, when to slow down to review, and when to tell a joke or not.",
      "Solid prof, explains things really clearly especially in a beginners class! Has loads of bad jokes, but really tries to engage his class and help everyone out.",
      "A good professors for beginners.",
      "A chill guy, young and dorky :) Knows his compsci though",
      "Dan Pomerantz is an awesome prof, he really got me interested in computer science. The course is usually a midterm and final, with 40% assignments, which aren't really that hard. The lectures are really fun and help you understand a basic level of how computers work and there roles in security, websites, search engines, etc.",
      "Dan knows his stuff about comp and his lectures are quite clear and helpful. Going to class helped me but lectures are recorded and slides posted. Assignments are long and hard if you haven't done any comp sci before, and exams were challenging but fair.",
      "I love Dan! He's awesome. I would highly suggest taking his class. Make sure to start the assignments early and see the TAs they rock!",
      "He is the best at McGill! You wouldn't regret taking his class.",
      "great prof",
      "Best lecturer at McGill. Took COMP 202 as an Electrical major and started doing software development thanks to him.",
      "Absolutely THE BEST professor I've learned from in McGill. He knows how to explain the class contents so that it's easy for first time learners to understand. If you're a prospective computer scientist, you do NOT want to miss Dan's class.",
      "Without doubt, the BEST professor I've ever learned from.",
      "Godlike. Straightforward and fairly graded assignments. Exams are a bit tricky if you're not used to taking multiple choice tests but quite fair.",
      "amazing is an understatement!",
      "Engaging and dedicated prof. Material can be challenging for some (like myself) who aren't as strong mathematically..but the crib sheet helps tons. Great course overall, awesome prof, take 202 with Pomerantz and you won't regret it.",
      "Dan is the best. If you don't know anything about programming he will make it easy for you to understand. Assignments can be tricky but just go to his office hours as well as the TAs. Exams are also tricky so make sure you know your stuff. It was a great class",
      "Dan is straight up the best professor I've ever had at McGill. This guy will go on MyCourses and answer every question personally, take questions b4/after class, and do anything he can to help you. This class was interesting, engaging, and enjoyable. His tests were very fair and you are allowed a cheat sheet. Hilarious dude, make sure you get him.",
      "Dan is great to listen to and he's very nerdy-hot. He's willing to help students and his lectures aren't boring, the jokes peppered in there are entertaining. However, I feel like as someone who didn't know anything about Programming beforehand there was still quite a bit of ambiguity. Great prof, not the easy course some say it is.",
      "AMAZING teacher! By far one the best ive had at Mcgil",
      "One of the best profs I have ever had, made this course very enjoyable. His exam was a little long, but not overly difficult, and he was willing to curve if needed (ended up curving by 5%). I would recommend him to anyone in a heartbeat, definitely considering a comp minor because of him!",
      "Dan is amazing! love him so much!",
      "Dan is funny and helpful. Avoid any other profs and just take any of his class!!",
      "Dan is perfect. Take this class.",
      "Dan is amazing.",
      "Amazing, enthusiastic professor BUT you need to work hard if you want to get a good grade in this course, the exercises can get challenging. If you slack off and never practice, you can never become good at programming. It takes time and effort to do well.",
      "Great prof. what more needs to be said. study hard for the final, you'll love his course",
      "Best Prof Ever.",
      "Dan is a very good prof. He is very clear and gives good analogies to aid in understanding. Level of responses on discussion board is outstanding. He is the most helpful prof I have ever met. Exams and assignments are long but fair.",
      "Best. Teacher. Ever. All the other reviews say it all. I mean seriously guys, can you get any more awesome than Dan???",
      "beauty",
      "Very good teacher. Very very helpful, cares about his students and is passionate about teaching. He is very young obviously and has stuff to learn, especially when it comes to not answering dumb questions and wasting class time and also probably getting some better analogies or not using them at all because they are confusing.",
      "Fantastic teacher, helpful and approachable.",
      "One of the best professor I ever had. He is truly passionate about CS and teaching. He is funny, clear and accessible. It is not a hard course but there is a lot of work (you will spend nights debugging assignments). The exam weren't too hard but extremely long (particularly the final), so he graded rather leniently. I definitely recommend him!",
      "Great professor. Always ready to help. and easy to understand one of the best profs i've ever seen at mcgill.",
      "Fun, easy to listen to, and much clearer than other Comp professors.",
      "One of the best teachers I've had so far at McGill. He really goes above and beyond to help his students understand and do well in the course.",
      "Dan is a fantastic lecturer. His powerpoints and lectures are clear, to the point, and funny. Prepares you well, *always* answers every question on the discussion boards and communicates with us well. If you take COMP202, take it with Dan!",
      "I love Dan! By far the best prof I've had in 2.5 years at McGill. So good at explaining concepts that are hard to get used to at first, fair marking scheme, really cares about his students, great lecture slides so you don't even need to go to class but you will anyway just to listen to dan talk &lt;3 Take this class as an elective! Useful + fun!",
      "Tries his best to explain difficult topics, often with analogies. Lectures are easy to understand and sufficient for exams. Assignments are at times difficult but so far, he's been the most helpful professors at McGill. His class was very fun to attend. I recommend him if you are taking COMP 202.",
      "Easily the best prof I've had at McGill so far. Extremely clear, very funny (in his own way...), excellent lecture notes. Assignments are long (not necessarily difficult, just long), but if you put the time in, you'll learn the material really well. He teaches so well that you basically don't need to study. Highly recommended.",
      "Dan's the best!",
      "Great teacher, intro to programming is a very hard subject to get into peoples heads but he puts alot of time into making sure anyone with questions is answered.. One of the best profs i've have.",
      "Clear, extremely helpful professor and responds rapidly and clearly to discussion boards"

      "She is definitely one of the most amazing profs I had for this year. So caring and such an amazing teacher who explains everything extremely well. She gave enough materials for you to study and prepare for the exam. SHE IS A WONDERFUL PROF!!!",
      "She is by far one of the best profs in McGill, very organized and accessible outside of class, do the assignments by your own, they play a crucial role in this course",
      "Giulia is very good at explaining computer science topics in a simple and accessible way. She is a good lecturer, and accessible for questions after her lectures. The lectures in this class were recorded and 100% attendance is not necessary, especially if you already have some programming experience.",
      "Excellent prof. After she finishes her slides for the lecture, she'll practice what she just taught you with the entire class in Java. She also is super helpful and understanding when you have a question or concern. Would highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn how to code, even if you had never done so before taking one of her classes.",

      "amazing.",

And to be honest, I don't know if CS is really the right thing for me, but she made me keep taking CS classes this year. Cross finger for myself!",
      "I LOVE THIS PROF SO MUCH!! I honestly was not a fan of comp sci but she is such a sweet and energetic prof! She always answered questions really well and really cares about her students, go to office hours!!!",
      "Favorite prof! So energetic and engaging!",
      "I loved this class The prof is really amazing, she explains really well and most of the class is working on programs which helps us understand. Make sure to do the assignments well because they count for a lot! Exam was fairly difficult.",

      "Amazing class and amazing lectures. She clearly shows that she cares for her students which is very nice. She manages to teach everything in a simple way that makes everyone understand. Simply, the best prof there is.",
      "The best of the best but the final was kind of not as easy as the previous years idk why; however, still my fav prof",
      "Such an amazing professor. Knows what concepts might be difficult and what questions might arise and modifies her explanations accordingly. Posts solutions to everything, and is just generally super clear. Giulia, hope you read this b/c it's my 4th year and I NEVER bother to rate profs but I came here specifically to say how great you are!!",
      "Amazing prof! Barely went to class, but the lecture recordings were enough to understand the material (the recordings also did NOT put me to sleep :D !). Super clear and does a bunch of examples. Assignments take time, but then you barely have to study for the final imo. Overall, great teacher and great class!",
      "So happy I had her for comp202. I had zero coding knowledge prior to this class, and her method of doing in-class coding really helped me. She explains very well and her slides are really helpful. I don't go to office hours but I emailed her several times for the assignments, and her replies were sufficient to answer my questions.",
      "Prof Alberini is amazing! She knows how to teach and engage hundreds of students who know nothing about CS. The assignments take up a lot of time, but they're rewarding in the end. I took her class in Fall 2017... the midterm was hard, but the final was much better. Just make sure you practice, practice, practice if you have no coding experience!",
      "Best prof I've ever had. The class isn't hard but for many, programming can be tricky; she made everything crystal clear and her lectures were so entertaining. Would take this class again just to have her!",
      "Excellent time spent taking her class! Besides being caring professor, Giulia is also a natural comedian.",
      "Great prof! Very detailed slides and instructions. Very manageable exams and assignments for beginners in programming. Would definitely take again!",

      "Lovely, lovely, lovely person! She has the ability to make you smile even during the midterm (if you happen to come across her questions). If you aren't in her class, you are certainly missing out because she's a beauty who makes you laugh more than you should in class. She prepares you well for the midterm and truly cares about your success.",
      "Amazing instructor! She will teach you how to code in Java step by step in class. Everything shown in class would be a part of assignment which is helpful. Final and midterm MC are a little bit hard. Overall, Giulia is an amazing instructor! Choose her!",
      "Clear teacher. So respectfulc humble, funny, and a beautiful person inside out. Also, theres something exceptionally lovely about her body language.",
      "She explains everything very well, and she is willing to make the class slower if she finds out students are falling behind. The assignments and exams are not easy, but there are old exams for practicing. Do NOT do the assignment at last minute, I suggest do it a week earlier before the due day. She is super nice and approachable.",
      "Giulia is a wonderful Prof. The notes she provided were clear and she was always accessible. The assignments were quite lengthy and the exams were fairly difficult, but overall, it was definitely a worthwhile experience.",
      "Giulia is an excellent professor. She explains the material clearly and efficiently and works at a pace suitable for the class. Assignments are very doable if you attend lectures and stay on top of the material. She makes the material interesting and engaging!",
      "I love Giulia!!! This class does require a good amount of work and the assignments do take some time, but it's definitely worth it and fun too. Warning-- the short answer questions on the exams are very very hard, but usually the long answer balances it out. I got a B+ but could've very easily gotten an A if I had put in work for the midterm.",
      "ok firstly, we wrote the final on the 20th at 9am and the grades were up less than 24 hours. super fun class! heads up though, the class is pretty tough. the assignments are very long and the short answer questions on the exam are extremely difficult. she's super funny and accessible outside of class. her typos are hilarious. we love giulia",
      "Giulia is such a sweet professor. Her lectures are very well-organized and all the recordings are online along with most of the codes we use during lectures (practice codes). Giulia also answers quickly to most of the questions about assignments and exams on the discussions (MyCourses) which is very helpful. I definitely recommend this professor.",
      "Sweetest and most caring teacher ever! Highly recommend her.",
      "Great teacher, keeps the class engaged and interested. Moves at the right pace. I am never confused about what we need to know for the test. Her assignments are clear and she gives tons of examples in class. HIGHLY RECOMMEND HER CLASS",
      "Kindest professor ! One of the best I've had at McGill, especially great for first year course. Incredibly caring and understanding, she gives thorough lectures and tests are fair!!",
      "Nothing to say",
      "Her lovely Italian accent makes you want to spend the entire day listening to her lectures! Very captivating and concise, she knows how to convey the material efficiently while successfully engaging 300 people. Her lectures are a nice balance of the material and class exercises. The lecture notes are thorough and sufficient for reference.",
      "LOVE HER! Clearly knows what she is doing and wants to see students succeed!",
      "SHE BAKED US DESSERTS FOR OUR LAST CLASS!!! She is the cutest person ever! Loves teaching and loves helping her students succeed.",
      "Giulia Rocks. Her accent is everything. She is awesome and i would love to take her class again.",
      "Professor Alberini is one of the best professors I've had at McGill. This is even more impressive given the fact I took her during her first semester teaching. One of the most caring people I have ever met. An extremely enjoyable class, with (dare I say it) enjoyable assignments that prove how much one actually learns from Giulia.",
      "Giulia Alberini, while in her first semester as a professor, has proven herself to be extremely competent in her teaching ability and lecturing. She is always very willing to answer questions with as much detail as needed and will go above and beyond to ensure that you understand the material. She is very supportive and an all around great person!",
      "Giulia Alberini is a prof who really cares about the success of her students, and is quick to respond to questions (in great detail). Her knowledge about her subject is apparent, and she does a great job articulating herself to first-time computer science students."

      "Mathieu is a great professor, butI can't say the same for comp561. It's kind of disorganized, not very much &quot;computational&quot; orientated, except for some simple dp algorithms and hmm models. I would say comp561 is below the expectation of a grad level course, and Jerome's comp598 is better suited. Maybe they should consider joining comp561 and 598.",
      "Very charismatic and a great lecturer. Gives topical and easy-to-digest explanations. Great CS/bio professor. One issue I had is that many assignments had ambiguities in the questions, so be careful and make sure to confirm with the TAs first.",

      "COMP 250 with him was pretty easy, he explains most things well. He sometimes makes spelling/grammar mistakes in his assignments that makes things not so clear, but overall there's nothing particularly bad about this course.",
      "This prof is a very good Comp-Sci prof. COMP 250 is really not too bad... There's relatively few things to remember, tests are open-book. The trick in this class is to PRACTICE, because you won't have time during tests... Go to class when Blanchette teaches, it will make things easier for assignments.",
      "Out of the three profs we had for this class, he was definitely the best. Was helpful after class and during his office hours and his final was very fair. Practice lots and know your data structures and you'll be fine in this class!",
      "The professor is extremely helpful. He is easy to understand and genuinely cares about his students. His assignments can be fairly long and difficult but he often reuses material from the past. The midterms were difficult due to time constraints but the final was very fair. All tests are open-note, which is nice.",
      "Long assignments but he's a good teacher.",
      "Great prof. Hard but not unfair, and made the material interesting and funny",
      "Excellent professor, seems to be overly interested in Bioinformatics though, would have liked to have seen some AI applications of the material. Great overall.",
      "Amazing professor. Loved the way he taught the course.",
      "He isn't very clear with the material he covers. I've seen other professors who explain the exact same material in a much more clear manner. I'm not sure how his (or TAs') marking scheme goes, but the assignments and exams are pretty hard to do well on.",
      "He's fine. Assignments are pretty hard. TAs take forever to mark. He's often disorganized (ie. we got our assignments a week after he said he would give it to us). In general, it's pretty good.",
      "If you're taking Comp 250, I would highly recommend this professor. He is very helpful and understanding. It might be worth noting that he is always ready to help during office hours if needed. Also, teaches what is required for assignments beforehand and re-uses a lot of the old assignments which is obviously awesome if you're a student =P.",
      "Great prof, fun course. All the slides are online, easy to follow.",
      "He's a good teacher, explains concepts clearly and logically, and he is always very helpful in class and during his office hours. Only part of this class I didn't like was that the assignments were very time-consuming and some were quite difficult in nature.",

      "Excellent teacher. He has the skills to explain things clearly. He is always willing to answer questions. He prepares all his notes as downloadable slides. I wish more teachers were like him!",
      "This class was saved by Mathieu. I heard bad things about this course from students who took it with someone else, but Mathieu made it a pretty good class. He gives out printed notes before each class!",
      "Great prof. He makes the material very clear and his notes are top-notch. He's always available to help and responds often to questions on WebCT.",
      "Great teacher, funny , cares about his students and replies to discussions and emails very fast",
      "Mathieu Blanchette is the best Comp professor at McGill! He makes everything seem easy (although the asisgnments are kind of hard!) and every single lecture is interesting. He always makes time for his students and really cares that we do well. Overall, an extremely enjoyable class.",
      "Mathieu rocks. He geniunely cares about his students and always makes time, answers emails and webct posts. He even had us evaluate him (unofficially) mid-course so we could benefit from the feedback he'd only otherwise have been able to take into consideration with less than a week or so left.",
      "Nicest guy ever. Looking forward to more classes with him. Oh, and totally hot. :-p",
      "Great guy! Very helpful and flexible. Really really nice.",

      "Very productive lectures, with easily legible and audible recordings posted online. Besides that, Doina seems to be the least organized professor at McGill. Feedback (grades on assignments, etc.) does not come in any form until the weeks directly prior to the final, and the students are not kept updated on this process at all.",
      "Great instructor. Very clear, very smart. Recorded lectures were great. She's pretty disorganized. Grading takes a long time. She probably needs more TAs to help with grading. Other than that, it was a cool class.",
      "Prof Precup is quite obviously an extremely intelligent woman BUT she is way too disorganized. Prepare to not get any of your assignment/midterm grades until the end of the semester. The assignments are extremely long and tough, the midterm was IMPOSSIBLE for a 50 min exam. Lectures are alright though.",
      "She is the angel of McGill CS. Besides her being a great teacher, you won't come across a nicer person at McGill computer science department. If she is teaching a course you have to take, take it with her - don't miss this chance.",
      "one of the best profs. very indepth knowledge of material. answer questions precisely and concisely",
      "Cool prof, really easy to work with. Very knowledgeable and insightful.",
      "She knew machine learning very well and explained with passion. Love her so much.",
      "Indeed the best CS teacher at McGill that I've seen. Takes it easy on you and really tests you on what she teaches unlike other professors. And boy, does she teach well. Perfect communicator. Take this from a CS junior year student.",
      "Best CS teacher I've ever encountered at McGill (very passionate), also she is very nice as a person.",
      "Explains and answers questions very well. Assignments are tricky though and sometimes you see the needed material 2 days before it's due.",
      "Very nice prof! Keeps your attention and explains stuff pretty well. Medium-hard assignments, but you learn a lot with her. However, does correction very slowly... wait like 1 month and half to get midterm grades...",
      "One of the best courses I took at McGill. She knows the material extremely well and is good at answering questions. Very good and long assignments.",
      "Excellent professor, she's very accessible and eager to help. Definitely wait until the fall to take her course; it's tough, but so worth it!",
      "Excellent professor.",
      "Great teacher! She really knows her stuff and communicates it effectively. She is a very busy person and so be prepared to have delays in your assignments (she'll usually drop one) and don't expect her slides. You must take notes. (Although the slides will come out eventually)",
      "Great teacher. Really disorganized, but if you take notes and listen in class you'll be set. Only class I looked forward to attending.",
      "She is an excellent professor. She is extremely helpful outside class. Always available in her office. Surprisingly whenever I told her that I need to talk to her, she would come to my office. Her homeworks are not easy, but are really useful and to the point. You might sometimes get lost during her lectures, but she is usually clear and helpful.",
      "Very nice teacher. Knows well the material but she needs to concetrate less on her research to give the standards. Very helpful outside the class. She is one of the best teachers in the computer science department.",
      "Long and hard assignments, but they help understand the material.",
      "My favorite class at McGill by far! Doina is a very proficient lecturer; she expresses herself very clearly and comfortably. The pace of the course is sometimes a bit slow, but the assignments are great fun. She is the most approachable prof in the department and always willing to help, but it is apparent that she is very busy.",
      "Great professor. She's strikingly brilliant yet extremely patient and helpful with those of us who are not quite at her level. Her assignments are not for the faint-hearted, but they are always interesting and to the point. Her exams are comparatively easy and very fair.",
      "Doina is very easy to listen to and she knows what she is talking about. She explains things well, but most importantly she is the nicest teacher, especially if you need help outside of class. Her assignments are a little long, but the final was OK, and the project was cool! She also marks easily.",
      "This course was poorly organized. That is the bottom line. Doina was very nice when you went to talk to her, but is quite boring in terms of lectures. They got quite monotonous. The project however, was really cool.",
      "Very good prof and a very nice person too. Her classes are a bit too easy though.",
      "incredible professor, the best one in cs, and a really cool person as well.",

      "One of the best, loves teaching! Although he did not provide the answer key for the sample exam, barely any course profs do at McGill. He went over concepts thoroughly and was open to questions in class which is vital for learning. Altho the course can be tedious KS cares about his students. Hard but doable. Youll do great if you put in the work!",
      "Kaleem is a supportive and genuine professor who cares about the success of his students. I had trouble with one of my assignment submissions, and although he had no obligation to alter my grade, he worked with me to come to a fair solution, instead of taking the easy route and giving me a zero. Assignments are tough but all exams are fair.",
      "The homework is pretty intense but it forces you to learn the material well. You should start the homework early and also listen to the tips in class. Prof was accessible by email and before/after class. If you work hard, you will learn a lot.",
      "Great prof who is being judged unfairly by some who don't realize that in any CS class, a lot of the learning comes from looking stuff online and teaching some stuff to yourself. Also, lecture recordings in this class were a lifesaver and allowed me to thoroughly understand topics I could not comprehend in class. High class avg and fair exams.",
      "I think that Prof Siddiqui is a great teacher and his assignments, though overwhelming at times, were really great ways to learn the material we're taught in class. As frustrating as coding in MIPS can be, I personally found it to be kind of fun and it definitely has made me a much better programmer. His exams are very fair and easy to do well on.",
      "Siddiqi is a caring professor who teaches in a clear and organized way and always keeps in mind whether the students have understood the content better. Admittedly, some of his assignments are tedious, but I am very thankful for that. (Remember to start homework early :)) The mid-term and final are not hard if you review thoroughly.",
      "Kaleem is a meticulous prof. He explained everything in detail except sometimes a bit disorganized. I gave 4 for difficulty because of the assignments, they really took us a huge amount of time. Midterm and final are very manageable though.",
      "Kaleem is a good prof. When you stay focused you get a lot from the lectures. The assignments were very hard. The first two were okay but the last two escalated a bit much. But I will say, they forced me to become a better programmer and apply myself. My biggest advice would be just to have a good support system to get through this. Its doable!!",
      "Gives heads up for the whole course and keeps a reminder to what's covered n what's next n how we progress: u never feel lost in the scope of material, despite the details. assignments were so tough but examples in class help and I prefer chalkboard, tho recordings were there too . He cares- available, good attitude when asked. Prepare to learn.",
      "Kaleem is the perfect example of a caring professor. The material is tough at the end, the assignments are harsh. However, he is aware of it and takes the time to make sure we can succeed. He answers all questions, I can't believe the amount of time he could spend re-explaining things when we were confused. Great prof overall, would recommend!",
      "The experience of being taught via the use of blackboards while deriving mathematical aspects was very good and different from most professors these days.",
      "Although Siddiqi doesn't seem like the most pleasant guy with the tantrum he had about lecture recordings and attendance, I felt that his teaching was solid (especially with the sped up lecture recordings), the assignments were challenging and fair (I learnt a lot from them), and the exams were definitely fair too. The midterm was a total joke.",
      "The recent negative reviews are basically meaningless because they are by people who are just mad because he wanted to remove the lecture recordings. In terms of the actual quality of his lectures, teaching, and exams, he's quite good. Hard assignments but easy/fair exams. Probably the best prof to take this course with.",
      "When you sign up for a class, you're making a commitment. If you can't make that commitment, don't sign up for this class. Lecture recordings are there to help, not to substitute. If you show up to class, you'll learn a lot of very interesting things. Very knowledgeable. One of the four assignments I found to be a bit much, manage your time well.",
      "Good lecturer. Reasonable grader, tells you what to expect on exams. Puts emphasis on research project and will give you good advice and feedback. Very approachable and extremely nice. I wish all professors were like him.",
      "He's a thoughtful prof who really wants students to do well. Gave helpful hints on assignments and his exams were similar to sample exams.",
      "The assignments for Comp 273 were really really tough sometimes but he always listened to students and extended deadlines a couple times. Really good prof. Make sure you actually go to the lectures or watch the recordings. Kaleem is a great lecturer but the slides just confuse you more.",
      "Can't say more on Prof. Siddiqi. Very gentle and lots of knowledge into vision. A true good professor, easy to contact out of class and always ready to provide advice. Respect student's idea and situation. Good grading for assignments , mid terms, and project. Strongly recommend!",
      "Always helpful, steady pace during the entire course. Lets you know if something if really important. Explains all the things on black-board instead of running through slides (unlike Precup), which is really helpful and doesn't become a load during finals.",
      "Good Teacher, although he whipped through the circuitry / boolean logic a little fast. Overall though, very clear, and helpful if you have any questions. Assignments were fair, as were the exams.",
      "Excellent teacher and a nice guy. Looks like he has E.T. fingers when he points at his overheads.",

      "Hatami is honestly the best lecturer I've ever had. He's an amazing professor who teaches difficult subject matter; People say he's difficult but I would argue that the courses he teaches are difficult, and Hatami does a very good job at making them easier.",
      "As others have said, Hamed teaches a very theoretical course that doesn't concentrate on implementation. However, I think his style is appropriate for this course. I actually found the midterm to be pretty fair, but most assignments and the final were very hard - he does not let you off easy. Otherwise, enjoyed the course.",
      "Very hard assignments, midterm, and final. Generous curve. Amazing lectures that are very clear and easy to follow. Active on FaceBook and is always available to answer questions.",
      "Harsh grader, but a good professor. The level of accessibility is amazing. You can contact him by email or on facebook. He explains materials very well in lecture, but assignments and tests are very hard. If you really value your grade, DO NOT take a course with him. If you want to challenge yourself and be a problem solver, he is your type.",
      "Tough course, but again its CS. Significant curve with midterm +20 and final also*1.2",
      "Hamed is a really cool prof, but the course workload is pretty heavy. For each homework, really takes time to think about. And midterm is heartbreaking, but it reminds u to take the course seriously. (and prof give 20% curve up for midterm). And final is very fair. Would like to take another course with him",
      "Great professor, really funny. Very useful assignments. Hard content but a much more satisfying class than COMP 250, because you actually learn things in 251. It was nice to be able to write in pseudocode. He curved the midterm 20%, definitely doable to get A- or A. Great textbook also (didn't go to any classes lol). 10/10 would take again",
      "His exams are hard, but he does curve well, so remember that. He places an emphasis on problem solving which makes the class difficult, but this is also one of the few classes where I simultaneously felt both beat up and satisfied. As a 4th year, I think I could count with one hand the number of classes where I learned more than with Hatami. 10/10",
      "Tough assignments but he has good memes, worth it",
      "Professor gives hard/fair assignments, and exams but will curve significantly if required. It's a hard course to begin with so it's not completely his fault. Altogether he's available for helping students and participates on facebook almost as much as the students.",
      "Great Prof, very knowledgeable about the material covered and is always ready to help on assignments/general questions via Facebook discussion group. Definitely one of the more challenging courses I have taken at McGill but his way of teaching really helps you grow as a problem solver and teaches you how to think.",
      "good prof, tough class",
      "Amazing Prof!! Had a great time taking this course with Hatami!! This could have easily been bland and dull but he makes it interesting. His assignments are tough but greatly increase your problem solving skills and creativity. He also has a fun sense of humour, posts memes on the facebook group.",
      "Recommended! He is the Djisktra's reincarnation . When taught the algorithms, you will be in a perfect world until you actually do an assignment or examination. You will learn that the mere application of the algorithms isn't O(1), there are extra layers to explore(just like a BFS). You can't take the shortest path if that rings a bell, man!",
      "Great lecturer, class notes very clear but be prepare to work and learn, you won't just be memorizing algorithms but rather learning them, Hatami will teach you how to think and become a better problem solver, great prof be prepared to spend time on assignments, definitely overall great experience",
      "You get what you put into this course, most students waltzed in expecting an easy A, didn't concern themselves with actually learning, and consequently paid the price. That being said, the content is beautiful and Hatami is an inspiring professor who you may dread at times but will ultimately respect for making you a much better comp scientist.",
      "Highly mathematics and proof focused course, however a very interesting class.",
      "This was the 3rd course I took with Prof Hatami. He teaches very mathematically (and that's why I keep taking courses w him), assignments are pretty hard but he is always there to help you. He answers the questions on discussion group. Not limited to office hours and as I've heard from another prof: &quot;he is the future of computer science at mcgill&quot;",
      "Tough class. Good class. I regret not putting more into it. Challenging but rewarding assignments that require you to have an understanding of the topics covered. To me, the point of this class more was to learn how to think. I look forward to taking more classes from him. Stop complaining about this being too &quot;mathy&quot;. This is CS. Get over it.",
      "Overall, he was a great prof, I enjoyed his lectures and he even throws in the occasional joke! I'll agree with everyone the assignment grading is extremely harsh and the mid-term was pretty hard. The course was taught like it was honours so all in all a lot tougher than it needed to be.",
      "Approachable and helpful prof, and the lectures were very enjoyable. He's a tough grader, but there was a significant curve.",
      "I had Hatami for both COMP 330 and COMP 360. His paste is really good, you can actually understand the material. The textbook was of great help for 330, lots of relevant problems. Attendance not required (could not attend any of these classes)",
      "He seemed so passionate about the material(especially the mathematics), which made the lectures very interesting and motivating. Also really helpful and kind, though my questions were most likely stupid. I hope to have another class with him :)",
      "Awesome prof. Keeps class interactive and fun by asking interesting questions."

The best part is that he genuinely likes what he talks about and it shows. He's also super helpful during the office hour. I didn't do very well on exams, but I swear to the god I learned a LOT of GOOD roughage.",
      "Tips to do well with Devroye: There are many MANY algorithms in this class that is covered, it is very important to understand these algorithms by applying them at least once. Familiarity/Memorizing(big O) with algorithms &amp; concepts is key to doing well. Assignments too difficult, not required to do well. I did no assignments and got 100 in final.",

      "Caring and passionate, fairly accessible given the class size. His lectures are crystal clear and rich in details. On one hand, it's great for beginners - but beware that occasionally he cannot finish the slides on time. Assignments might be a bit vague but TAs are nice and usually very ready to help. The all-MC final was easier than the quizzes.",
      "Many different algorithms are presented in the lectures that could seem difficult for an undergraduate with little background, which was my case; however, the low weight of final, 25%, made this class an easy A. I think everybody got a full mark on the presentation and there were only two assignments and we had an entire month to do each of them.",
      "Jerome is a solid professor. Sometimes the lectures got a bit dry, but Jerome is an extremely nice professor that cares about his students succeeding. The grading was pretty easy and the assignments were straight-forward for the most part.",
      "incredibly nice prof, I really enjoyed this course with him, the lectures may get boring sometimes but I learned a lot of stuff. even in his office hours he is super helpful and explains well !",
      "Reads off the slides, which can get annoying and I did not learn much from those, but a decent and nice professor.",
      "Incredibly nice and kind professor who got a boatload of rude entitled students this semester. If you did the work and actually read what was expected of you, you would do fine",
      "His lectures get boring as he talks slowly while reading his slides that are taken exactly from the textbook for the most part. However, he is very helpful as he cares about the success of his students and is always available to give a hand. Assignments are easy and his exams are fair and doable (lets you with crib sheets too). Overall he is good.",
      "If you have taken up many courses and you want to reduce your stress level then take up his lectures.",
      "Very interesting and essential course. Notes could be sometimes unclear, so the textbook helps a lot. The prof seems usually busy, but he's still very helpfull.",
      "One of the few professors who actually care about his students. If you raise a concern during the course, he will address it in a timely manner. He is also very knowledgable and his examples are very helpful in lectures when explaining the functionality of the numerous algorithms you would have to learn. A bit unclear at times but would take again.",
      "Good prof overall. Makes the material clear and concise. He has a thick french accent, and makes many grammatical mistakes when he speaks. But other than that, good."

      "Very clear as professor, tricky assignments but you learn a lot. Definitely take him if you can",
      "Amazing professor- easy/fun class. Definitely recommended as an elective.",
      "Loved him! It's not the easiest class, especially if you're not going into computing or engineering, but there's no crazy trick to doing well - read over the slides and PRACTICE. Petitpas was helpful, nice and made the material interesting. All around great class!",
      "Prof. Petitpas was one of the most helpful professors I have ever come into contact with. He bent over backwards to make sure every student understood what was happening, even if he was a touch brusque at times. This is a tough class, and programming is my world. He's an excellent resource, as are the TAs. I'd take a class of his again.",
      "Most helpful professor I have had. The material is hard, so going to class and doing the assignments will help only to a certain extent. It is imperative to understand the theory inside out, and practice programming. Do all the assignments on your own and the prof and TAs are good resources..Fun course and excellent prof :)",
      "The class is insanely hard if you're not in Engineering. I struggled soooo much. Remember this is a class about Java, and learning how to PROGRAM, so you're basically learning an entire new language. Assignments are crazy hard and super long to complete. Midterm was tough. I definitely do not recommend this class if you don't have to take it.",
      "He was a good prof, and I definitely learned a lot and did well in the class, but I'm still a bit disappointed that he marked our final assignment by using a program he wrote, and despite being a supporter of Open Source, didn't release the source code when I had concerns my assignment may have been marked incorrectly.",
      "in my year for our final exam Timbits were distributed.cool.this course needs hard work for the assignments and this prof makes it easier and clear-even though he's a little quirky.",
      "The professor is very good. He cares about the students, is thoughtful with assignments, and is attentive to the discussion boards. A very good and worthwhile class, but *hard*.",
      "Awesome professor. Really loves the material he teaches, and will spend as much time as possible to help students understand it. The exams and some of the assignments were relatively hard, though, so make sure you start them quickly. The midterm and final were very difficult to finish in the time allocated.",
      "He's a great professor =)",
      "hes a good teacher. and yes he gave us candy while we were getting RAPED and MAULED by the exam. For comp 202 learn as much java/programming over the summer, this couse is no joke.",
      "He spends too much time explaining very easy things to a couple of retarded persons. In case you're reading this professor: When you ask if we have questions and nobody answers it's not because we are dumb, it's because we understood everything and because you're good ;).",
      "He gave us candy wile we were being raped by the final! how cute is that&#63; awesome prof... thumbs up!",
      "COMP lectures are not that useful so most of the class spends its time on the internet. Mat is a great prof who finds creative ways to explain things. He's very helpful on assignements if you have questions. He's also the biggest open source nerd I know.",
      "i LOVE him! he is the best! he answers all questions posted on webct and he was of a great help to me and other fellow students! he's so cute, awesome, handsome, funny, and most importantly, he is so HOT! and yes, obsessed with linux/Unix!",
      "An awesome, enthusiastic and funny prof indeed!",
      "No Comments",
      "He's a little weird... and a lot obsessed with Linux! he hates Windows so if you don't want to fail, don't mention that you are a Windows user in front of him!! but he's rather good, I never had any knowledge about programing but thanks to him I'm getting pretty good!",
      "He smells funny. Often hears the same thing! &quot;Hello World!&quot;, and in his words, USE FIREFOX not IE."

Tedious assignments. Interesting group project. Exciting game development based on the models developed. Good to mention in your resume.",
      "U'll end up with the following: - 6 Credits - An 'A' (if you are willing to work) - A solid project - Cool friends (possibly your team-mates / the prof himself ;))",
      "One-year course. The expectation is to develop a game and give a demo. Having a team of 5 and choosing the implementation platform on our own really helps. First sem involves design phase (which is theoretical) and the second involves implementation of the game. He uses Modelling techniques which make it a lot more easier. Easy-to-score mid-sems!",

He encourages opting for different groups for assignments and project which really helps. He is always approachable.

      "do not take this class if you have NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE to computing and programming. i find it extremely hard to keep up in lectures, as he simply reads off slides very quickly, and does examples quickly as well. The assignments are hard for beginners as well. Definitely does not seem like an 'intro' course.",
      "Great professor with a very cool attitude. Always helpful, and I think his courses are the easiest place to get an A. However, his classes can be kinda boring, and extremely slow.",
      "Very cool Professor ! Some of the assignments he wrote were really interesting. He is also very nice and helpful. I wish he could go faster with the material though, the course pace is *very* slow. But that might be because of the nature of the course.. Anyway, J\u00f6rg is really cool, and I highly recommend him. The two other instructor were good too!",

Amazing class!",
      "Derek just seems like an all around great guy. Decently interesting lectures although the subject material is kind of dumb. The homework is a fair bit of work and is pretty much weekly but is graded very easily. Midterm was a joke. Would recommend this class.",
      "He was my first computer science professor and by far the best. He explains very well all the materials and is super nice. However if you don't go to class or don't listen very carefully, you won't pass.",
      "Super nice prof, super clear, makes sure everyone understands. Not a tough grader either. A not too hard assignment every week and an easy midterm and final that count for only 25% each. Definitively an easy A, would recommend if interested in the subject of the Internet world and computer science for beginners.",

Great class and a fantastic professor.",

Ruths is kinda disorganized but a nice guy and a good prof. Lots of assignments that you need to do research for but he's a fair grader",
      "Derek is an amazing prof! He is very clear in his explanations and makes the material interesting. I had never taken a computer science class before and found myself easily understanding and really enjoying his lectures as well. He is very friendly and loves answering any questions you think of. His family is adorable, too! Great guy all around.",

      "SUCH A GOOD GUY! He gives too many assignments and his questions don't exactly match the course material, but they can be figured out with some quick googling. And he bought the class doghnuts like four times (and handed them out in the middle of the final..) <3",
      "Had him this semester, he answers e-mails frequently, one of the nicest people ever, he makes his classes relevant to the real world and makes you think but gives you whatever help you need. Easy on the eyes!! I think I've learned more in his class than any other class this semester. HE'S GREAT!",

      "Melanie is an awesome professor who can actually explain everything in a very clear way that I think most people can understand easily. She often gives very interesting examples during class and very helpful assignments for students to work on.",
      "Melanie is one of the coolest and best profs (and the best of the 3 choices as far I heard). However, comp202 was not an 'easy A' course unlike what most people say. So you really have to stay on top of the material especially if you've never taken a comp course before, and the assignments are killers. The final IS way easier than the midterm.",
      "She's a great lecturer and everything she says in class is relevant to the exams. Lectures are recorded so going to class isn't necessary but going allows you to get in the info in digestible chunks and also ensures that you have adequate knowledge to complete the assignments. Tests can be detailed oriented and tricky but still are very fair.",
      "Midterm was WAY harder than the final - got a 60 on the midterm and a 86 on the final. Melanie is hilarious and very good at holding the attention of her students, loved this class. Easy A if you work through her recommended exercises",
      "Ended up being the prof of all comp202 sections. Even if you are registered in another section, I suggest you study from Melanie's slides, or even ATTEND her section instead even if registered another. Super comprehensible and concise explanations appropriate for newcomers to programming. Her sections are recorded too.",

      "fav prof",
      "COMP202 was very hard for me, but Melanie is great at explaining, and will help walk you through problems when you get stuck if you reach out for help. Her slides are crystal clear and in-class exercises are well-designed, so follow along diligently. She's also very funny and chill :)",
      "Mel is probably my favorite teacher at McGill. She's a kind person and a good teacher, and can be really funny with her example problems! Comp 202 is unsurprisingly, an easy A, but she made it all the more enjoyable. Thanks Mel!",
      "She is a great teacher, clear and helpful (always)! AND She is actually very funny!!! CHOOSE HER BECAUSE SHE IS A REAL ROCK STAR!",
      "Brilliant teacher!",
      "To my surprise, Melanie is actually quite hilarious and entertaining. As a bonus, she is quite the cutie if you know what I mean ;) Which is nice since it is rare to have such eye candy in the computer science department or any STEM department for that matter. Overall, it's still COMP 202 so you know the drill. Easy A if you put in the work.",
      "Another year, another wave of ambitious students eager to learn coding enrolling in what is inarguably the most popular elective of all time at McGill; COMP 202. That said, this teacher teaches just as well as all the profs in the other sections. It's COMP 202 after all, it's an easy A if you do all the assignments and do both the midterm and final",
      "I ended up in Melanie's section cause Pomerantz' section was full. That said, she is a great lecturer! She explains everything clearly and in a way that even inexperienced people in computer science or other STEM fields can understand. Just because Dan Pomerantz is the most popular prof for COMP 202 doesn't mean you should overlook the other profs."

The exam was fair, and then she even ended up curving significantly. This was my first course in the computer science department, no issues catching up.",
      "Great projects! Great course! Great Prof!",
      "Well. She curves a lot so you got probably an A.",
      "Joelle Pineau is the best CS professor I've had at McGill. She is very professional and very clear. She does her best to explain the material and wants you to learn. She answers e-mails, doesn't look down on students and encourages everyone to participate. Though, she makes you work for it quite a bit. Expect more HMW than a normal 3 cr. course.",
      "Joelle speaks like a textbook. This is impressive but unhelpful - she often failed to simplify the material and provide concrete examples. At least half the course was pure math and probability. Her slides make it very clear what you need to know though, so watch online lectures. The AI tournament was a great project though. Very worthwhile class.",
      "Lectures can be a bit dry, but definitely go see her outside of class because she explains things very clearly then. One of the better Comp Sci profs @ McGill. The assignments can be kind of a pain though.",
      "Very nice professor, somewhat hot. She is clearly an expert in machine learning and she is always helpful to students. You will definitely learn a lot with her, grading is good even if you are not answering totally correct. Recommend her courses!",
      "Professor and lectures were very interesting, well organized, and easy to follow. Exams were slightly difficult, but fair. Weekly assignments required too much work for a 3-credit course, but the grading distribution allowed you to skip/not count almost half of them.",
      "Certainly more organized than Doina Precup. Course was very interesting, but marking was harsher than what I was told about other AI profs.",
      "AI was FUN,clear assignments, PERFECTLY structured course, fair midterm, very good slides, explains the stuff really good, know what whe is talking about, very helpfull out of the class, flexible, late assignment&#63; she repesct your excuses, easy to follow, is an asset for McGill"

But if you visit her during office hours, she will be more than happy to help you out. A hard class, but totally worth it. It will prepare you for anything.",
      "Her class is not for the faint of heart - it's a lot of work for an intro class, and the averages were always low. However, she's a pretty good teacher and very approachable. The assignments are difficult if you're not in the comp sci state of mind, which turned a lot of people off of this course",

      "A bright, young, and caring professor. Very patient to help students to learn. Practical learning outcome and deserved grade with an inadequate comp sci skills to start this course. Every student succeeds with the right attitude.",
      "He's a nice guy. There are a decent amount of assignments, but as long as you stay on top of them, they're not too hard. If you don't know Java, go to lecture. He did make a few mildly transphobic comments at the start of the term. It never went past this, but it's something to keep in mind if that would discomfort you.",
      "He is a nice prof. Just pay attention in his class and you will be fine with the assignments, quizzes, and tutorials.",
      "Really good prof but I found this course very tough. You will spend at least 6 hours a week doing homework. You don't need to go to class.",
      "Good prof, I took COMP1406 with him. There was no textbook for this course, but he provides you with excellent notes, that are even better than a textbook. My primary complaint is that there are assignments every single week, which is difficult, considering that there are 4 other courses in a semester, and some students have jobs.",
      "Such a great prof! Took intro to robotics with him, and it was the best choice I've made this year. Classes were really fun and engaging. He's very easy to approach for help too!",
      "Very easy prof, classes are very enjoyable and super easy to understand. Applies learning to real life which makes it even easier to understand. Instead of making us read textbooks, we get to read his awesome notes.",
      "He has a solid understanding of the course and accepts that not everyone taking it needs to be there. However it is advisable to attend lectures as he does add in tips and tricks that he has learned from his experience which would otherwise be hard to find. He is fun and engages with the class well. No textbook everything he teaches is in the notes",

He is very resourceful and always keeps in mind that a lot of us don't have a lot of prior programming experience. His course notes are godly. If you go to all the classes and tutorials, you will definitely get a good grade.",

      "Makes programming ideas simple to understand with metaphor-like examples.",

      "he is a good prof..",
      "Good talker, which is rare for a computer science prof. Material can get boring, but he does his best to keep class interest. Assignments were fun, made things that would actually be cool to talk about. Course will require work, but it's worth it.",
      "Probably the best teacher I've ever had, and I'm in first year uni! He is very clear, insightful, helpful and is just a very good teacher. He covers a lot of topics and he does a lot of real world examples that really cement how a good programmer should think. He's also funny, enthusiastic, and makes the class fun. Great teacher.",
      "He's a great prof, the assignments aren't difficult and if you go to class you will know everything you need to for tests and assignments",
      "He's a pretty good professor. There's no textbook for the course, but Professor Lanthier has all the notes for the course (which he made himself) posted online, which are sufficient for learning the material. He goes through the notes each lecture and explains them well using examples, without just reading. He's willing to help anyone who asks.",
      "Great professor! Very funny and likes to include students in examples. Goes through many examples in class and has fantastic notes! Don't expect the class to be easy near the end though.",
      "The course was pretty difficult, lots of work.. but in the end it was lots of fun (for me, a lot of my classmates had completely different opinions about the course and the prof). The professor was very helpful either way, and he always tries his best to help us even though he makes a few mistakes sometimes (he's only human). Definately recommended",
      "Best professor a first year can ask for. No curveballs, great notes, great guy. If you've taken java programming already, you're set. If you want an A+, listen to Lanthier and to the tutorials. Awesome prof though!",
      "His notes are so good there are rumors that students from other universities use it. His lectures are not that usefull since everything is in his awesome notes.",
      "He is SOOOOO funny.",
      "He is perfect in teaching",
      "Very easy if you already know how to program, although I admit I learned 1 or 2 new things from the course. Teaches reasonably well, no complaints (other than tutorials are a little lame).",
      "Decent prof, but occasionally unprofessional (and offensive) - did not appreciate the handful of transphobic comments he made during a couple of his lectures. Assignments are decent; tutorials were mind-numbingly dull; tests were a piece of cake.",
      "Goes out of his way to make java fun and the learning sort of sneaks up on you while you're having fun in his class. The clear and comprehensive &quot;textbook&quot; for this course was really a collection of course notes which are available free on his website, but a dead tree version is available for cheap from the CS society.",
      "Very clear, and very helpful. The entire course notes were available for 20 dollars and contained amazing examples and descriptions. Take his class if you can.",
      "Had him for 1405 and 1406. Mark goes through his example code in class, very helpful as he will explain why you are getting certain errors and really help you understand what you are trying to do. Assignments could be challenging but were fun. Very willing to help during his office hours too. To top it off his notes were free on the course site",
      "If the real workplace and the later year courses will have unrealistic, vague, and confusing situations like his tutorials and assignments, then I'm changing my major to Mathematics.",
      "Great prof, one of the nicest guys.",
      "He is the funniest guy in the world, and not because he tries to be. Comp 1005 was boring as hell, but it would have been a lot worse with any other prof. Try to get him at all costs if you must take a comp course.",

      "He was always funny in class, was able to mix his own humour in with the lectures, definitely knew what he was talking about, kept me interested for the full 90 minutes early in the morning... This year, I got Juan Pablo Zapata, and he is brutal, avoid Zapata his class puts me to sleep, Lanthier has been the best proff I've had at Carleton so far",

Fair to easy marker, but at least for this course, you need to attend and do the labs to get a good mark. I got a B+ because I only did half the labs.",

      "Replies to email inquiries instantly. Assignments are easy but hard to understand what he exactly wants. Tutorials are fun. The lectures are kind of useless, just him talking about either the past or the present or how he is going to massage a program or a function.",
      "I don't know why everyone is hating on Lou. Had him for Comp 1406, Comp 3005 and Comp 2406 and never got less then a B+. Yes its hard to stay awake and listen to him. But he lays out exactly what he is asking for on the assignments which are worth half your mark. He won't tell you everything, but this is comp sci get use to learning new things.",
      "This Prof gives clear idea about what is Comp 1406 and trying to make it easier than you thought. I would highly recommended to take comp 1406 with this prof if you are looking to get an essay A+ or to Pass the course. His assignments are not that difficult but you need to focus on his assignments and his materials that he will post it later.",
      "If you are looking for an instructor who tells you every detail to memorize to pass the class, then you should take another course. Louis lectures in a older style, suitable for students who know how to learn on their own. His assignments are fair; the requirements are clearly spelled out. The material isn't hard, if you learn it you will get an A.",
      "Good prof, Lots of Assignments but that comes with being in Computer Science. He's Always willing to help and has interesting stories .",
      "Very good prof and easily my favorite Course of the term, Nel is up-to date in what employers want and need. he also adventures into upcoming technology's and Assignments are practical You do not want this teacher if you don't have a good foundation in Computer science, he teaches theory not code. Much of the learning is done independently",
      "Lou Nel was the best Comp Sci prof I've had at Carleton. He gives thorough, interesting lectures. Very helpful and very fair with assignments and tests. He is really passionate about algorithms and it made for a fun class! Highly recommend taking a class with him.",
      "One of the best profs ever taught me. Quality teaching, excellent slides, and educational assignments. By doing them, you get real life experience. The best thing about him and his courses is that he is current and always updates his slides. His tests aren't easy but fair.",
      "I love this guy. I've been lucky to get him three times so far (1405, 2405 and 3005), and these have been (not coincidentally) three of my most enjoyable courses. I don't attend class, and don't buy textbooks - his slides are sufficient for A+ grades. Assignments are applicable to material and very educational.",
      "Good class to attend as he likes to code on the go.",
      "His stories are hilarious. Especially the ones about 'software kills'",
      "Amazing prof. I don't know anyone who didn't ace this course. Makes everything very clear, tests are fair and assignments straightforward. If you can get him as a prof, I hearilly recomend doing so.",
      "This guy is probably one of the best, if not the best programming profs I've ever had. He types up all the code in front of you, and all the mistakes he does is actually a good thing, because you can actually see what the compiler will spit out to you and understand how to solve them, before going off to your assingments and ripping your hair off.",
      "Great professor! Speaks very clearly and gives real-world examples to some fairly complicated subject matter. All assignments are very reasonable, and Nel always gives ample time for completion. A grade 'A' teacher for sure!",
      "He is a VERY fair prof, assignments are relative and not too challenging. The lectures style is not formal for 1405 or 1406 but we are talking about learning a language, you are expected to learn a lot on your own. He reinforces the key concepts. Overall fair and helpful. If you are a comp sci major you should have no complaints about this course.",
      "Great Prof!",
      "Great prof, explains things well, has a lot of class participation, tends to ramble a bit and go off topic, but he knows his stuff and loves to share it. Great to go see one on one, but he talks soothingly and keeps the lights low, puts you right to sleep if you have him in the morning.",
      "Probably the single best professor I've had at Carleton. As much as other people complain about his teaching style, you can tell that he knows his stuff and wants to share it with others. He makes a lot of small errors in a class, but it makes him seem more human and easier to learn from. I wish every prof were Lou Nel :D",
      "No matter who says what. Lou Nel is the best professor in the school of computer science at Carleton U. He's pationate and he teaches every little detail of what you need to know. If you concentrate on his lectures and do the assignments properly, you will have a good understanding and you will do fine on the exams. Great prof",
      "This is one the best comp sci profs. Make sure you get to have him at least once! Class is always interesting with him. He does make a lot of mistakes but thats what makes it all the more amusing and interesting. Plus that actually HELPS you, so you won't make the same mistake yourself. Loved his analogies. He has a Facebook group dedicated to him!",
      "The only prof I've had for 3 classes and I'm damn glad. If only every prof at Carleton was Nel",
      "I took several classes with the guy, and he knows what he's talking about.. and cares about his students, so overall I would recomend him",
      "A NICE PROF",
      "He should teach a history of computer programming class. His lectures are funny, if only for the nullpointers that he generates, and it's fun to actually SEE code in class, he gets big props for that, it's nice to see a prof who will put his butt on the line infront of students, and doesn't mind if he makes mistakes.",
      "Good prof. Creates and debugs code. Relates code to real-life things that make you pause and say WTF&#63;! (public/private) Causes more NullPointerExceptions than everyone else, combined. Not the brightest. Very bad at programming (lots of bugs, stupid mistakes, bad programming style). Talks too much about C++ and SmallTalk. This is Java, not C++/ST.",
      "nice explanation",
      "Very smart, Very clear and make courses look very easy. defiantly take his courses",
      "this professor is honest and helpfull and explains everything well , but the problem is little bit with the TA who oppress and deal unfairly in marking or don't help , his idea of the tutorials is practical , it helped me but the Ta is discriminating in tthe way he helps students , he helps some and ignore some and igonore some",
      "He's not the most exciting guy, but one of the few profs who actually makes material easy to understand. I'd be lost without the guy.",
      "Had him for a few classes, and he's my favourite prof at Carleton! Although he sometimes repeats the same story... But it's all in good fun :P",
      "Awesome prof. If you are taking 314 make sure it's with Nel. He made a theory-type course turn into one of my favorite lectures to attend. Very funny guy as well.",
      "Very nice guy who genuinely wants to help his students learn. He's a bit rambling and a bit of a ****ter but over-all he's a good prof to have. C++ is a ridiculously large language to teach 2004 with.",
      "Lou is an amazing prof that makes a comp-sci course that's about reading and writing papers interesting. Also, his classes are not to be missed because there's always some hilarious reference or story that's not only funny, but on topic too.",
      "Really good prof. One of the best ones in Comp Sci at Carleton. Not particularly easy when marking, but not too hard either. Listen in class and you'll do fine. I learned a lot from his lectures.",
      "Easy, but boring. Uses the same notes for the last five years, but is too lazy too correct simple typos. Take him and get an easy mark in COMP 2404.",
      "Great teacher, one of the best in compsci",
      "Nel is an amazing prof. He REALLY knows C++ and how to teach it really well.",
      "Great teacher with excellent real world experience."

He provides a free book which basically is his notes for the class, which is super helpful.",

      "Great man.",
      "Took 3801 Algos for Modern Data Sets. Very interesting course but is tough to wrap your head around, math and theory course. Fantastic prof though &amp; funny stories too. Delivers info very clearly and always asks if anyone is lost. Be prepared to put in time outside the class room. Reading is a must. This type of course is not for everyone. Cool tho",
      "hardest 3804 prof at Carleton, but also the best. If you value really learning something and going into depth, he's the way to go. It is tough though. If you're a scrub you can complain I guess.",
      "Very difficult class but he shows you everything you need to know in the lectures- so pay attention! Assignments were difficult and the exams were very difficult- the final was insane",
      "He's a very good lecturer, but his tests and assignments are very difficult. If you end up taking COMP 4804 with him, be prepare to struggle and use all the resources (office hours etc) available to you.",
      "He is most talent professor, always give example orientate example, which is help to understand big data in death level.",
      "Great prof. Teaches a tough course really well. Jokes at times. Explains concepts and asks repetedly whether it is understood.",
      "Very good prof teaches stuff from the textbook but is really clear on everything he says. The only word I can say about him is \"bale\" which means very good bale!",
      "A great professor who teaches very good material and is easy to understand",
      "Will expect a lot out of you in terms of assignment difficultly and frequency, and for exams. Teaches very well though, and does his best to improve marks (best X of Y assigns taken, made final easier after a hard midterm) Take this prof to learn, but be ready for a busy workload. Clear in class but still might have to look for online material",
      "Amazing prof, one of the few keeping the standards UP in computer science. Sometimes a bit hard to keep up taking notes in his class but overall very good at explaining material that most people find difficult.",

      "Great prof, he expects a little much from students but he's a good guy. Assignments are reasonable but so was the midterm... if we would have had like 3 times as much time! Overall I'd recommend him.",
      "he is a good teacher, but this course is hard no matter who teaches it.",
      "Pretty good teacher, but the material is pretty tough. No part marks makes it very tough.",
      "Easy to understand and teaches well, but he marks insanely hard and rarely gives part marks. Don't make mistakes in this course, it costs you big time.",
      "It's somewhat torturous stuff to get through, but he keeps a decent sense of gallows humour throughout. Good online notes, if you're looking to skimp on the textbook.",
      "He's kind and concerned about how well the students do. He's always prepared, and knows the material like the back of his hand. He's also willing to admit when he doesn't happen know an answer off the top of his head. Rock on!",

Gives bonus marks on assignments, and gives examples of tests so you know what to focus on. BTW, there is a good chunk of Prolog on final, so be ready for it (use 99 Prolog questions).",
      "Robert was one of the best profs in Computer Science, I took 2 courses with him, got A+ in both of them and TAed one of them. if you have a chance to take any course with him do it. his lecture notes are more than enough to study from. it's better if you actually attend the lectures.",
      "Had Collier for 1405 and 1805. Pretty boring, pretty overhyped. Overall good though!",
      "Had Robert Collier for data structures in second year, TA'd for him the subsequent semester for COMP 1005, and have him now for COMP 3007. He's one of the few profs in the CS department who cares about the quality of his teaching. I remember second year, when an assignment was a bit ambiguous, he was in the labs at 10pm with students clarifying it.",
      "Great teacher so work hard and you will be rewarded.",
      "You'll have to work hard but he's a great teacher and just about always has an answer to student questions. Assignments can get pretty tough but they're fair and tie-in to appropriate lecture material.",
      "Best prof in the world",
      "Robert is awesome. He is super nice and the lecture is not boring at all. The quizzes and assignments are not hard. Robert is really really good.",
      "The best professor I've ever had in Carleton U.",
      "I really enjoyed his class! The final exam, tests and tutorials were fair and reflected what was done in class. The assignments were a lot tougher and really required lots of googling at times to figure out what was going on, but I did appreciate the challenge and it didnt end up hurting my mark too much.",
      "He likes to joke around with his students and takes time to cover ALL questions people ask. He also pushed back assignment dates if we hadn't covered the material to that point.",
      "I came in with no programming background and found him and his course very fair and a great intro to programming, although the tutorials were far too hard sometimes. As long as you do the readings, practice questions, start assignments early, and seek help when you need it, you'll get an A+. Would definitely recommend him for COMP1405.",
      "One of the best profs I have ever had. Easy lectures, funny , respected , helpfull and very inspirational.",
      "Until now he is the best professor in Carleton for me, I've taken 1805/1501/1405 with him and his teaching methods are just the best, the assignments have clear instructions, gives you samples for the quizzes and answers your emails very fast. Whenever I see him teaching one of my required courses I will always register for his class.",
      "Unbeleivably accommodating and an excellent lecturer",
      "Best Prof of all time, trust me, he is amazing. His teaching is interesting, assignment is not simple but specifications are very clear, he is very helpful when you ask him questions after lecture or at his office hour or via email. He responds emails very quickly as well. Sample tests are basically the same as the actual test. WOULD TAKE AGAIN!!!!",
      "Awesome and likeable character.",
      "He genuinely loves computer science, and you can see that in his interesting lectures (also computer games of all sorts in this case). Tests and assignments are graded fairly, although may take a long time to be given back to you. Overall my favourite professor this year!",
      "Collier is a LEGENDARY prof. Easily my favourite professor I've had through first year. His passion for teaching and computer science comes across quite clearly in all his lectures. He's incredibly reasonable with all his deadlines and marking schemes. He lays out everything you need to do well.",
      "Keeps you interested and teaches well.",
      "Great guy. Good sense of humour and he knows his stuff.",
      "He is a great Professor who is clearly passionate with what he's teaching. He actually takes the time to ensure that he carries most people along during lectures. The only problem is that the assignments are numerous and are often much more difficult than the examples covered in class . Still a great professor though.",
      "Great prof, organized, not boring. Only thing I would improve is the readability of his assignments.",
      "Very passionate, clear in his explanations, an overall joy to have. If you are new to programming the class might be difficult, but if you attend the lectures and especially the tutorials (plus a bit of self teaching - it's computer science after all), you should be able to easily pass with a good grade. Take as many classes as you can with Robert.",
      "Although the material is hard, he shuffles due dates and test dates to make sure students understand material. A very nice person in general, funny at times, and you can tell he loves what he does! Make sure to attend lectures when possible, and get help if you miss one.",
      "Difficult course, but Dr. Bob (nobody actually calls him that) is a shining light. The material is difficult, but the prof is a master. He will shuffle the schedule, assignment deadlines, tests, just to make sure that all his students are on track. He is witty and congenial, has great respect for his students, and he ensures fairness in the course",
      "Robert is my boy",
      "Awesome prof! and great lectures! He is really passionate about computer science and encourages asking questions. His tests and assignments were fair (not Easy A and not impossible A) and you'll see that only if you attended class regularly and have done your assignments on your own ( I also recommend going to TA office hours if you need help) .",
      "A mandatory course for my degree. Overall, you can tell that this prof. thoroughly enjoys what he teaches (lives and breathes computer science). However, the amount of material required for a \"beginners/intro\" level course was great and much work was required to feel caught up to computer science degree students taking the course for their 1st year",
      "Great prof and person, really enjoyed his class. Slides are well done and very helpful if can't make the class",
      "Robert is clearly very knowledgeable in his field (programming). He answers questions clearly and competently. The tests are not overly difficult, however the main difficulty in the course were the assignments, which can be very difficult for someone who has never programmed before. If you are a CompSci major, then Robert is a good preparatory prof",
      "Overall good prof. A lot of the complaints he got was for comp 2402. He was forced to structure the course the same way Jason Hineck was teaching his section. Hes a good prof if he can teach it his way.",
      "Overall a very good professor, good speaker and prepared for lectures, test weren't difficult. End of the course felt a little rushed is my only complaint",
      "Great Prof. Really into the material. Don't be afraid to ask him to clarify any concepts as he is new to this school and really does not know what has and what has not been taught. Lectures are really interesting with a lot of good demos. If you have any doubts don't be afraid to go see him in office hours as really helps to clear things up.",
      "Dude genuinely loves computer science and it shows.",
      "Decent prof that's nice and approachable. Assignments aren't too difficult, though it's easy to lose marks if you don't read the instructions carefully. Also, if you're a Rick and Morty fan, keep an eye out during lectures for the profile picture on his computer.",
      "Excellent prof, excellent lectures, very inspiring, and all around nice guy. Tests aren't too difficult, assignments are a kinda hard but very fun. Tests are not as hard though. Pick this guy if you want an awesome prof.",
      "Seems to want everyone to do well. Will go way off topic to answer almost any question in lectures. Graded by TAs so he's very open to appeals if you did better than what was graded. Strict marking scheme so if you follow the instructions exactly 100% guaranteed, easy to lose marks if you do anything different though. If you can program 90% easy"

The TAs agree that this course is a LOT harder than it should be.",

Assignments are always based on course material. As someone who only started programming for this course, Python has never felt more possible.",

Makes getting an A easy if you pull your weight and do your work. takes time to answer questions in class, and doesn't hesitate to repeat a concept if you don't get it the first time around.",
      "Best prof I've had at Carleton. He makes a tough subject fun. His lectures are on point, I really recommend everyone to attend. Also, the course textbook is free and just as clear as his lectures. I learned a lot from his class. It wasn't easy, and it was a bit of work. But it was very enjoyable and rewarding.",

He records his lectures with his a personal video camera, providing the lecture videos for free, and uses a free open source textbook.",
      "Pat is one of the few professors that make me feel like I'm getting my money's worth in university. He treats us with respect,t which is more than I can say for a lot of my professors. He's more helpful for 2402, as algorithms are his expertise and clearly his passion. He explains clearly and makes it possible to get good grades in a tough course.",
      "Very good prof, knows his stuff.",
      "He basically just programs in front of the class and asks students what his next step should be. He also posts all the code he writes in class online.",
      "He's teaching style might not make the material easy to understand for students who have no previous programming experience. He's assignments are sometimes challenging, which is good or bad depending on your perspective. lectures are uploaded onto youtube which is very helpful. I enjoyed his classes a lot!",
      "pretty easy, exams are fair and dont require to study much",
      "Great prof! Pat can communicate complicated data structures in a way that is clear and easily understandable. The fact that you can resubmit your assignments and have access to help from T.A's throughout the week is a huge advantage. Highly recommended.",
      "He posts all his lectures on youtube which makes things really easy. If you sleep in just watch the lecture later!",
      "This class was great.#1 free textbook... #2 assignments are marked by a computer and you can resubmit and get a mark mutiple times (no excuse not getting an A+) #3 there are TAs ready to help 4 days a week 10 from 10am to 4pm (again no excuse not gettin a A+). The content present is extremely important if you want to be a serious programmer.",
      "Refreshing passionate about the topics he teaches. His courses aren't easy, but they're manageable, and he's a reasonable person. Best prof I've had this year.",
      "Great Prof, has a well organized web site and easily extends assignment deadlines when asked.",
      "-hard mid-terms, exams and asssignments -makes up his own stuff -study the same courses offered in MIT and u will do fine.",
      "Great! Thanks for making the course better than I thought it would be!",
      "No Comments",
      "He's very good in probability and such stuff required for teaching Data Structures. His assignments have a whiff of geometry in them, which makes it exciting. The teaching is precise, the guy is a good man, but he should smile more often !!"

      "I initially hated this course but you'll realize how important it is to computer science. Its a tough course so ask Dr. Smid for help. If he sees you putting the effort he'll literally show you how to solve the problems. He's basically a knowledgeable grandfather, the issue is class size you must speak up. He doesn't know who is struggling.",
      "Professor Smid is excellent at providing and explaining the material, but you have to go to class to understand it. Reading his free book is good to understand what he says in class but it's not enough to study solely on that. Assignments are challenging but going to TA office hours really helps. All his past exams and assignments online.",
      "Make sure to show up to class otherwise you won't do so good. The textbook is honestly useless, its vague and doesn't explain things very well. The textbook was written in such a way that its supplementary to the lecture notes, not vice versa. Otherwise Michiel is a good prof and provides all his previous midterms/assignments to students to study",
      "Fantastic professor, hard course. You could probably get away with just using the textbook. He writes the textbook and teaches out of it, but you should go to hear his explanation.",
      "Great lecturer, great textbook written by him. Assignments and tests fair. You can survive with just the textbook and skipping class.",
      "Great professor - he's a great lecturer and is very thorough with his explanations. Attending his class is almost a must if you can't grasp the material by yourself. I found the assignments to be hard but the exams weren't too bad if you studied previous ones (he posts all of them)",
      "If you don't understand anything see Smid immediately during his office hours, hardly anyone does. Assignments can be tough but there not worth much, so don't fret if you do badly. Learn and do well on the midterm and final. The TA's are helpful, specifically Alexa. If your close to a pass/fail Smid is more likely to try to pass you then fail you.",
      "If you plan on a part-time semester, this is a perfect course to squeeze in as it's very time demanding. For notes: copy his chalkboard work during lectures. Grade is based on 4 assignments + midterm + final. TA hours are crucial to solving assignments. Midterm and final very similar to past ones which he posts + their solutions: best way to study.",
      "Fantastic prof but tough material. He is very knowledgable about the subject but he teaches PRINCIPLES through examples so get ready to do some of the work yourself on assignments and going to TAs is pretty much a given. Great prof tho and very fair and quickly replies to emails.",
      "Excellent professor. Provides help if you need it, and does a good job at breaking down difficult concepts",
      "Michiel Smid is very good at explaining things. His assignments are hard, going to TA office hours of his office hours is pretty much necessary unless you are really good at math-based courses. A tutorial in 2804 would be nice to have. Also, he is quite a funny guy.",
      "Awesome prof! I didn't go to many of his lectures but his clarity in what was needed to pass and expected of students is unparalleled. I got told he replaces the exam with the midterm, not true. Hence the A- :)",
      "Amazing!",
      "He simplifies a tough subject and provides a comprehensive, detailed and structured outline of what he's going to teach in each class, ahead of time. He's helped write 3 books (one of which is the course textbook, which he provides for free) and has helped author about 200 journal articles and conference papers. Approachable and helpful. 1010.",
      "Amazing",
      "Awesome prof, amazing lecture.",
      "A good prof",
      "Awesome proffessor, I will see him in 2805",
      "Clear & thorough. Slight accent can be humorous. Had very good TA's. Don't need the textbook.",
      "very clear and concise teaching style. Classes are amazing, although you can learn most of the stuff from his notes. Goes through everything nice and slow so no-one is left behind. Extremely helpful when you ask for it during his office hours.",
      "Clear, precise, thorough. Amazing hand-written notes with lots of examples. Smid makes a good grade in a hard course seem perfectly attainable.",
      "One of the best professors here; his teaching style exhibits that all-to-rare quality of being very precise, extremely thorough, and yet somehow not boring or coma-inducing. You really feel like you know something you didn't know before when you finish. His penchant for early morning classes result in his lectures being criminally under-attended",
      "Very easy to understand, makes everything easier, really good notes",
      "I had him for my &quot;Theory of Computation&quot; class as well as my COMP1805 class. He's a really good prof, and his accent isn't so bad (in fact i think it improves the teaching experience lol). He teaches stuff in a nice and slow way to make sure everyone understands and gives enough examples. Recommended prof",
      "Really good prof. Good explanation. If you make notes in class you definitely do not have to by a book. If you come to his office hours he will help a lot and explain everything.",
      "He kick's ass",
      "He is simply the best prof for these classes. He will teach you what you need to know in a very easy and understanding way. Highly recommended! A+++",
      "I honestly don't think people appreciate this guy until they've taken a course with someone else. You're not going to find someone better at teaching this material. He's a little boring, but he teaches you all the important material in a way that anybody can understand. I highly recommend him.",
      "The class itself was excellent. His notes and lectures were clear and he gave plenty of examples. Unfortunately the final SUCKED. Otherwise, I'd take another course with him.",
      "Good prof, assignments and classes are easy but the exam was INSANE, nothing like assignments",
      "Assignments were a little tricky, but otherwise pretty easy. Smart guy, extremely systematic and rigourous. Focused on big picture. Best CS prof I've ever had.",
      "gave a clear note. But I don't like the course that he teach",
      "He repeats the content of the course directly from the book. His examples are from it as well. Good for one-on-one questions affter class.",
      "Really hard course. You get it or you don't. Smid's a good guy though, but for this course you're on your own, it's just hard to teach people this stuff.",
      "Algorithm sure is not an easy course. But he is the kindest prof I've ever seen. He is always happy to answer questions, although that cost him one extra hour.",
      "will explain stuff again and again until you get it,not a bad prof,a little hard",
      "Very thorough prof -- maybe too thorough for 285, but would be good for 384/484",

      "Amazing prof. The course material is hard, but he teaches it very well and solicits feedback from students to improve his teaching style. He is always open to explain lecture material and go over assignments outside of class as well.",
      "Really cares about you learning the material.",
      "Probably one of the best profs I've had. He's extremely passionate about the things he's teaching, and he explains the concepts very well. The course is still extremely hard though, and you have to attend his lectures. I missed 1 lecture and I was completely lost for a week. He tries to help out students as much as he can, holds many review classes",
      "Through out all my 4 years at carleton, i can truely say that prosenjit is the best proffessor i have ever had. He knows his stuff very well and has the unique ability to convey super complex material in a way that students can easily understand. It is very rare to encounter a proffessor as great as bose. We need more people like him to teach.",
      "One of the best profs at Carleton. Really knows how to teach and you can tell he has a passion for it. 3804 is a difficult course, but he really tries to make it as simple as he can. Really wish other profs could be like him. Thanks for a good semester!",
      "One of my favorite professors. He explains things very well in lecture, so I suggest attending class while it is not mandatory. He is extremely helpful if you attend office hours. Finally, he provides sufficient resources such as a textbook and practice problems which are free online. Good sense of humor, and ultimately an amazing prof.",
      "There are a few teachers in people's lives who really leave an impact, Prosenjit Bose is one of them. Not only is he an expert in his field, he truly cares about the learning his students receive. He goes above and beyond his usual office hours to make sure that you as a student gain a deep understanding of the material.",
      "Attend those lectures because they are worth every penny. It's hard material to follow but he's an expert in the field and is ALWAYS willing to explain everything. His office hours are golden. Try to take every course he teaches because you will be thoroughly rewarded.",
      "Hilly recommended prof. Not an easy course , but Jit is the best person to teach it. He can explain discrete math in a way anyone can understand. Try taking it with Jason Hineck then tell me the difference. Since discrete math has a little bit of Calculus and Algebra, Jits has made it easy for me to understand Math 1007 and Math 1007.",
      "Very funny, friendly, and great at teaching. Tests are pretty easy, but assignments can be tough. Overall though you'll do well if you attend the lectures (which you'll want to, since this guy is awesome)",
      "Love this guy. No way I'd go to these lectures if it weren't for him. As for the class itself, the tests are pretty easy and worth the bulk of the mark. The assignments are a lot harder but not worth as much.",
      "Great Prof. Funny and Smart. Assignments were relatively difficult while tests were much easier. He posts notes online which are handwritten and can be difficult to read from time to time. Exam was multiple choice. No textbook required.",
      "Class isn't easy, Assignments were incredibly hard and the TAs have way to much control over what mark you can get, Class is kind of boring but he's a decent prof and a funny guy. The material is definitely tough, and TAs can screw you over if they don't like you.",
      "A laid-back, honest and helpful professor. His lectures help to alleviate the difficulty associated with the course. Some improvements I would like to see are clearer hand-writing, and perhaps a bit more detail on the notes. Otherwise, a good prof.",
      "Awesome prof, very clear in class and knows his stuff. Assignments weren't too difficult but there was a lot of them.",
      "We brought a first year student into a 4th year Algorithms course for the first few lectures. Jit teaches so well, our first year was keeping up, answering questions, and understanding. He makes hard topics obvious. Go out of your way to take this Professor.",
      "Every computer science student should be taking COMP 4804. Jit is legitimately interested in what he teaches in this course, which makes lectures much more bearable than reading notes on your own. Not a walk in the park, but far from impossible. Learned tonnes, had lots of fun, recommended fo shiz",
      "Not an easy class, but definately would often go out of his way to help students out, even started to do his own tutorials, very nice guy too. Just make sure to follow his rules.",
      "Awesome prof! Makes early morning classes fun. Often telling jokes in class to help make the content more interesting. Knows his stuff really well. Often helps out on forums and often moved test dates and assignment deadlines around too. Even provided extra tutorials out of his own time to help the students grasp the harder concepts, best prof!",
      "He was a very funny, laid back prof.",
      "Best teacher I have ever had. Keep it up, it was a great course, regardless of how hard the course material was.",
      "Jit is an excellent professor and he's very keen to help all students. He will also make you enjoy Comp/Math 1805 if you're lucky enough to get him as a prof. I strongly recommend you attend as many tutorials as you possibly can because the Ta's have a lot more time to go through everything with you then the time allocated to each topic in class.",

      "Hard class, great prof",
      "Really nice guy.",
      "really nice guy. i found his tests to be simple since he gives you practice tests very similar to the tests. the assignments are challenging, but you can get a good mark if you start at the right time and don't leave it till the last night. you'll do good in his class if you try just a bit.",
      "very good teacher,i like his class",
      "Good Prof",

      "hard course, tries to help students learn it",
      "Amazing prof. One of the most helpful/friendly/clear I had. Definately one of my favourites. Answers questions thoroughly and with clarity. Can take a hard subject and make it fun. Very fun/entertaining to listen to - you will not fall asleep in class! Very down to earth - easy to talk to. Says &quot;Uhhh..&quot; a lot, haha! Great prof all-round!",

      "Awesome dude. He taught the hardest 1st-year Comp-Sci course and made it relatively fun. He's got some hilarious stories, and let us order pizza for the last class. I've heard later-year students saying how cool he is too.",
      "Class was useless, stupid, boring. The only reason I went was cause Bose is cool, more like one of us than a stuck up computer science prof like most of the comp sci department.",
      "He knows his stuff, and he's good at explaining it. Very approachable -- If you don't understand something, you can just ask him.",
      "His tests and assignments are hard. Great prof for those who want to learn. Not for the lazy ****s looking to breez through university without any effort."

I've since emailed him a couple times asking for advice and for other such stuff and he's taken time out to email me back with advice and such! Awesome prof!",

Always very helpful and ensures that the material is very thoroughly understood. Cares very much for the students in his lectures and would recommend to everyone every time.",
      "Best Prof Ive ever had- funny, and genuinely cares about his students success. Will answer any questions you have in or outside of class, fairly quickly too! He teaches the course material in the most basic way possible, and if youve never coded before you might find it difficult, but if you do all tutorial Qs and follow along youll be fine!",
      "Dave is the professor you will remember after finishing University due to the care and effort he puts into each and every lecture. He goes out of his way to make sure students succeed, maintaining constant communication even when he is not required to. He explains computer science in a way that even beginners can become advanced by the end.",

One thing I want to point out is that the tutorial problem seems more difficult than the assignments themselves, but that's just my opinion. (But don't worry the tutorial is nothing to worry about)",
      "Best prof for comp sci possible, The material of this class is very easy to someone who has been programming for while but I still show up just because this prof is so good, and also entertaining. If I could have him as a prof for every single comp sci course, I definitely would.",

      "Nice guy, easy class. When he says he likes to reuse exam questions he isn't kidding. Seriously, check his wiki for old exams, actually do your assignments. Easy.",
      "Funny guy, knows his stuff. True geek. Tries to be helpful, but the course tries to cover so much material that he doesn't have time to explain everything. Gives you many chances to get extra marks (assignments have bonus parts). Course is a piece of cake if you've done webdev before. Take it with him if you have a choice.",
      "Thought OS would be difficult, but Anil is an amazing teacher. Makes early morning lectures worth going to. Didn't even need the textbook. Don't take OS with anyone else.",
      "Really great guy. Yes, the term paper was a bit of a surprise but you're gonna need to be able to write term papers if you make it past 3rd year anyways so it can't hurt to get some practice. Lectures are also very good. You'll actually learn stuff if you just show up to class.",
      "Excellent Prof and very nice guy. He teaches very well and has very fair tests and assignments. I recommend to anyone.",
      "Really interesting speaker, and helps out in labs. I like him!",
      "only prof ever to answer emails at 3am. a very fair marker, and makes class very interesting to attend. if only the rest of the profs at CS were like this...",
      "Don't let the name scare you, he's American, speaks English, is good at getting the material across, answers your e-mails helpfully, and is a pushover for giving assignment extensions when the class asks him to. Be warned, though: He likes to give term papers in place of lab work for COMP courses."

He has a very fun way of teaching, as he's very motivated in imparting the material to his students. Go to the TAs for help for the assignments! Free online textbook!",
      "Only one thing can describe his courses: they're just a game. Da da da da da. Very nice professor who cares about the students. Go to class and you'll get an A.",
      "Good professor. Made material clear and understandable for the most part. Took the time to answer the questions that students had and revisited the material if needed. Would recommend taking course with him. Just beware he has a habit of writing small and will erase notes from the board even very quickly.2nd half of the sem teaching was incomplete.",
      "Very enthusiastic and passionate about his material. His class is still full, and gives assignments that help you understand the content even better. Showing up for his class is a must though, because if you miss something it's difficult to get back on track because of the material. If you liked Jit bose for 1805 you'll like him. Best prof ever!",

      "Best prof. Most of the courses he used to teach are now being taught by Jason Hinek and I can swear there is a big difference in marks.",
      "The most amazing thing was about this course is that he is posting his lecturer on Culearn and youtube in order to understand the concepts. I highly recommended to take this course with him. His tests were not that hard. He gives sample test in advance and it is similar to it. great Prof So far for this Course.",
      "I loved how he posted his lectures on youtube, since he talks kind of slow, so I watched on 2x speed. He also uses a Surface Pro as a visual and posts everything he does on it. He's a really knowledgeable prof and you can tell he's made the effort to prepare perfect lectures, with just the right amount of examples for the content.",
      "John was the best teacher of my last semester. He easy very clear in his explanations and always answers any question. He also writes almost everything he says in the class and posts on cuLearn (even he does this, go to his class because some examples that he teaches in class will appear on assignments and quizes).",

He gives every possible resource to students, including good office hours, all lectures posted online, practice tests, and is very friendly.",
      "Great professor. Very clear and is avid to hear questions or comments during lectures. His notes are very useful but can be a tad difficult to read his handwriting sometimes. Try to follow along and code during lectures. Definitely helps absorbing the material.",
      "John is a professor who clearly loves to teach. He is passionate about his field and makes difficult concepts easy to understand for others. If you are given the choice to choose John over another professor, I highly recommend you give John a shot.",

      "Best professor I'ver had.",
      "An amazing prof",
      "Great Teacher, he responds to your questions and emails instantaneously sometimes within minutes. Discrete Math isn't an easy subject, but he's there for you and will make and effort for you if you do. Highly Recommended prof, Carleton would be foolish to lose him.",
      "Pretty good teacher, however his lectures were kind of dry... Not much enthusiasm and basically all you can do (since all of it is coding) is follow along on your computer and type what he types. VERY helpful though, I emailed him numerous times throughout the semester and he got back to me within the hour at the most, with very clear answers.",
      "Show up to class and listen and he makes super hard subjects very do-able.",
      "He is really patient and does not intimidate or patronize when students ask him questions. He is very helpful and easy going. Going to classes definitely help. I'd recommend him to everyone especially if you're new to computer science.",
      "John teaches one of the toughest courses I've ever enrolled in, yet answers all questions instantly and concisely without even needing to think about it.

      "Excellent professor who is very clearly passionate about his subject matter. Knows his stuff very well and explains difficult concepts clearly and concisely.

If you gonna take this course take it with him !",

He marked and returned our midterm on the same day it was written. really respected!",

His Labs are long and usually go the full 3 hours and are extremely boring His lectures aren't bad, people say he picks favourites but he really just picks people that will answer and normally it is the same people but if some one else puts their hand up he will pick them",
      "Assignments are extremely hard, especially the first one. The mandatory labs are long - you won't likely get to finish your work. Marcel is an amazing lecturer. His greatest strength is making concepts very clear.He does pick his favorites.",
      "Great teacher. He's super motivated and interested and makes beautiful powerpoints to help you understand.",
      "Very good. Interested in making sure you understand.",
      "Turcotte is teh****",
      "OMG, oui, il est super dr\u00f4le! Anyway, very funny prof, well prepared classes - he tries really hard to explain everything in an understandable way, and usually succeeds. I would highly recommend him to anyone!",
      "Par Dr.Java tu veux dire... Daniel&#63;&#63;",
      "HOT appearance absolutely. Smart,charming,nice and cool. His assignments are kinda challenge with thoughtfulness. Clear and interesting presentation that kept me awake. He answered my questions like a mind reader. All u can learned is not only about programming but also presentation skills. He is the BEST prof. i've ever seen!!!!!!!",
      "Do prepare(like reading notes) before going to the lecture or else it would be quite difficult to understand what he say.",
      "Time goes fast in his class. He asked for long assignments .I like his method of teaching.I hope I can get a good mark in final :)",
      "Great prof, I love his English! Very helpful and nice. But the course is tough, just to remember these assignments every week... ouch..",
      "Great teacher but he doesnt go through the material quick enough (gets me bored).",
      "I wish all profs were as cool as this guy"

      "Very responsible prof who records all lectures online. Also willing to help if you go to her office hours for midterms and quizzes to correct past mistakes.",
      "All the lectures were recorded and the code from them was available as well which made studying a lot easier. The lectures were always interesting and very thorough. I had absolutely no prior knowledge of programming and no interest in it either but this ended up being one of my favourite classes and I did well in it.",
      "Shes a very good professor and is very smart, but she is very mean, condisending, and has no patience for students who are not doing well. Be prepared for her to tell you to drop the class.",
      "Shes literally a great prof. She was happy to see her student progress. Shes one of few prof swho really care about her students. Good prof! P.s. if your performance is good enough, ull receive her hidden-email.",
      "She's probably your best option for ITI 1120 since she's very knowledgeable of Python and definitely goes out of her way to explain things from the very basics in the first week of lectures incase you have 0 programming experience. That being said, her assignments/exams/quiz are VERY hard. Imo, the biggest plus is that she records all the lectures.",
      "A solid prof, she teaches the material really well and puts it all up on brightspace however some of her assignments are difficult, as well as the midterm and exam as they are multiple choice and very tricky.",
      "A solid prof, they are very knowledgeable. The assignments can take a while but aren't too hard if you actually use the two weeks that are given instead of starting the night it's due. The tests are mc which can be tricky but you have a lot of time to work through them, so as long as you do them carefully and study you'll score decently.",
      "There's nothing new when it comes to mid term and exams. All exams and midterms are multiple choice (same everywhere). Explains well in class which is recorded and uploaded on her youtube channel for revision purposes. Her assignments can be hard but not impossible.",
      "Her lectures are very clear but the tests are multiple choice which can be a little tricky.",
      "Great first class and introduction to computer science using python. I would recommend taking your first year course with her. If you already know programming it is an easy A. Class could be a challenge for those who do not have past experience however, VIda explains the material well.",
      "I had very little programming experience, but I still got over 80%. Attend the lectures, and do practice problems. I liked the multiple choice exams. If you understand the logic behind the lines of code, you'll be fine. Some students who had programmed before did mediocre because they didn't understand what a line of code meant to the computer.",
      "Very interesting prof. Course material is very basic if you have past experience in programming however, so attendance probably isn't mandatory until later in the semester with recursion and objects. If you have no experience in programming she's a great prof. Very thorough and fun.",
      "Adore her. This is a heavy workload class but if you put in the work, you'll get the A. Be very careful with the multiple choice though- you might feel confident but make sure to read the question carefully. (I may have failed the quiz even though I thought I did well...) Also, do the labs at home so you don't have to stay through the full 3 hours.",
      "She is a really good prof. Explanations are really good. Dont really need to go to her lectures since she posts them online. Labs are good. The only hard part about the course is her assignments. They get pretty challenging and VERY time consuming. If you go to her and ask her for help, she will definitely help you.",
      "Vida is not a hard prof at all; it's the subject matter that is hard. She is great at explaining. The reason her tests can be difficult is because you need to have an understanding of EXACTLY what the code is doing in order to get the answer... which is how it is in the real world. I find her to be a very caring prof with an awesome personality.",
      "she amazin at explaining",
      "Her lectures are very easy to follow and they're all recorded. Just do the work and review the lectures and you'll do fine. Make sure you know exactly what's happening in your code step by step and do all the Coursera work because that's what the exams are like.",
      "Vida is the best professor I ever had. Please , just take ITI courses with her ! She did her lecture by showing how to write code from scratch and she will explain every syntax that she used. You will know how good she is when you take ITI 1121 with another professor",
      "Amazing prof! All of her lectures are recorded and she goes through everything step by step in front of you so it's easy to follow. Beware, she doesn't prepare you well for the midterms. Make sure to do the coursera exercises and you'll be fine. She says the textbook is mandatory but I never used it.",
      "Great prof, assignments were manageable, just beware of the midterm and the exam, they are multiple choice and easy, but it is also very easy to get mixed up between answers. So as long as you know what you're doing it's fine. She is very clear in her lectures, so it shouldn't be a problem in understanding concepts! Take her class if you can",
      "Dr. Dujmovic is fantastic. I cannot say enough good things about her lectures and her support for students outside of class via BlackBoard. She is organized; she gives multiple examples; she reviews tricky concepts before exams; and she's funny. I hope to take a course taught by her again in the future.",
      "One of the best profs I've ever had. I had never programmed before but found her teaching very easy to follow. Her course was also very organized. She had lots of office hours and ran on online discussion forum where you could get help. Her assignments were quite long though. This course is not overly difficult but requires you to put effort in.",
      "Very good prof, cares about students.",
      "She's a good and honest teacher. The class is well structured and you learn a lot. She expect you to work on your own so don't ask question during classes if you didn't work at all. She gives a lot of free material you can study on and lecture are available on video in blackboard.",
      "Vida is a good teacher that explains er lectures very well. The DGD's are long, but it has a variety of exercice that we can do. There is a lot of office hours during the week, which allows student's to go ask questions when they're available. Overall, the teacher was positive which made it fun to learn.",
      "Dr. Dujmovic is one of the best professors I've ever had on the criteria of listening to a student's questions, and offering an answer that is both pertinent and informative regarding the nature of the question, and doing so in a manner that is neither handing students the \"correct\" answer, nor is it diminutive of the student's uncertainties.",
      "I had no previous experience with programming and didn't have to much trouble with the assignments and usually felt quite confident. Didn't do as well as I'd liked on my midterm but Vida was happy to help me to understand where I went wrong during her office hour. Key to passing is reading the textbook and doing as many practice programs you can",
      "Vida is an excellent programming prof. If you don't know the language being taught, you should attend all lectures and ask any questions you have, as she always monitors her online forum through blackboard. An easy A if you already know the language, just make sure you're familiar with recursion and string/list operations.",
      "Assignments can be tough without programming experience but they're doable. Midterms are tricky because she doesn't do much to prepare us. Make sure to do the Coursera work before the midterms and understand the exact definition and outputs of everything without testing it the code. That's the only way you'll be ok on the exams.",
      "She is the best professor I've ever seen in uOttawa.",
      "Very helpful when you email her with questions, and if you can't make it to the office hours, she tries to accommodate your schedule.",
      "Challenging without previous programming knowledge but still do-able. TAs are fantastic and can clear up any doubts while the professor herself is fairly good",
      "assignments are very hard, while exams are ok",
      "She is a fantastic professor. Assignments are easy if you listen to all her lectures. All material including videos is posted on Blackboard, so you dont need to attend the lectures. She is very helpful and answers all questions online.",
      "Great prof for introduction to Java. Only thing is sometimes she skips steps leaving you lost for the rest of the lecture, although she will answer any questions with pleasure. This class is very hard to take notes in, as she has prewritten code that she explains most of the time. Assignments can be tricky, but theres an online forum she hosts",
      "Awesome. She is a really good teacher for java. If you go to her lectures and listen, you will be fine for all assignments, and exams.",
      "Amazing teacher. Really knows her stuff. All assignments are very clearly indicated, and she is quick to reply to any ambiguity via the online forum. Does not accept lateness of submissions, and failures are failures - no exception. I found this fair."

      "Easily the best CSI professor I've had. Exams contain no surprises, lectures are engaging, and professor is cheerful and clear (also emails back very quickly for assignment questions!). Attend class, pay attention to everything, and do your assignments, and you'll do well. I loved this class, but would take any course if taught by Ms Boyd!",
      "She is fantastic! Engaging, assignments and midterm reflect what is taught in class. Highly recommend!",
      "5/5 would recommend. This is the type of prof that makes you want to take a certain course simply because she's teaching it. Great lecturer, crystal clear expectations for assignments and exams, good class notes, and very fair. Show up to class, fill in the notes she provides, and participate, and you'll have nothing to complain about :)",
      "She's always smiling and giggly. But I don't like her teaching style, what she says in class is what goes. If you solve it using a diffrent method and still get the same answer you'll get part marks. But she's willing to answer any question during her office hours, if there isn't a line of students. Don't buy the textbook its just a guide.",
      "She is the best Prof I have ever seen. If you are in her class, you are a lucky dude!",
      "Definitely my favourite prof in the faculty. She gives you these fill-in-the-blank lecture notes that you follow along with for the lectures; I find them extremely useful and very well executed. She gives great lectures, has great lecture notes, and has a great sense of humour. Fun to talk to outside of class, as well.",
      "Amazing teacher! Explain things very well by writingdrawing in her tablet, and it's much better than reading any textbooks yourself. Textbook not needed, but must not skip class, since everything is displayed in class. Many tests, no assignments. Practices with answers are released before tests. I'd love to try her other courses.",
      "One of the best prof at uO, really enjoyed professor Boyd's class, make this subject very interesting!",
      "best notes ever. one of the best profs at uOttawa. I wish every prof could make notes like her. Keeps you engaged in the course.",
      "Sylvia was one of the best CSI profs for UofO.",
      "In the faculty of engineering/csi I'd say she is probably one of the best. Although I could not stand her teaching style, and her voice was so damn annoying. Her tone of voice sounded like she thought we were pre school kids. Her notes are only given out in class so it's pretty much mandatory to go. Her examples help 100% with assignments/exams.",
      "It was a really well taught class.",
      "Amazing prof! She was always super enthusiastic about the material which really helped to keep it interesting. Very good at communicating the ideas too.",
      "Very friendly. Good sense of humour. Great professor overall.",
      "She is definitely one of the best professors. She is very clear about materials. Assignments and exams reflect back on what we learned during the class so I always feel everything makes sense. She loves what she does and teaches very well. 5 stars for sure. Extremely recommended!",
      "I wish all the CSI courses at uOttawa were taught by professor Boyd.",
      "CSI 3105 - Excellent professor. I loved her teaching style. If you go to class and pay attention you will succeed.",
      "She is an excellent prof. Take her class, for sure!",
      "great prof!",
      "Very engaging personality, she makes you attend every lecture if you want to pass, as the assignments/tests often refer to things only discussed in class, but not in the text. The handouts are templates you must complete by attending classes.",
      "She is an awsome teacher!",
      "ATTEND EVERY CLASS! The class notes are missing the most important parts, and you must go to class to get them. She also drops hints about the exam. Overall a hard, tedious but important course. She brings a great deal of enthusiasm and clarity to the subject. One of the few professors who is actually good at teaching and seems to enjoy it.",
      "She's a very good professor. She is clear in her explanations. However, getting an A+ is very difficult. The main reason for this is because you need to do some analysis on the tests, which is not easy considering the time restrictions.",
      "She really really really really annoyed me. S's so annoying you'll think your mom is teaching! Main problem is that she states and restates the obvious, and then asks about 3 different students to repeat it... YAWN!",
      "Excellent Prof. Best in CSI. I took 2 electives with her after taking my degree course and loving it. She is the best.",
      "she wants to make you think which is good. she is a **** of a marker.. dot your i's and cross your t's.. if you dont go to class and take good notes (she provides a good guideline for the lectures) then you are screwed... textbook for the course was terrible.. she is a good prof.. definitely conceited and a feminist but good anyway.",
      "Best CSI prof in OU (not saying much though)",
      "one word, Excellent. Examns and assignment were challenging, to be expected from a third year course. thank you professor Boyd",
      "Knows her stuff and knows how to explain it clearly. Complexity analysis simply makes sense once she explains it.",
      "She is an excellent teacher. Has very good knowledge of her subject. you dont need any extra notes.:)",

You don't to put in much effort for a good grade!!",
      "First time I took this course, it was with Karmouch and I failed. But this time around that I took it with Hao the course suddenly felt easier as Hao actually cares. She would also sometimes give real-life examples and that helped tremendously. Finally, as others have said, please do get ready for a tough final.",

      "One of the best profs ever. She really cares about students. She is there for you to get an A+. Our room was changed but she talked to the Dean several times to change the rooms back b/c the new one was a worst learning environment. She gives bonus marks for attendance and on midterm. Never seen a prof give so much support to her students.",
      "Qi Hao is definitely the most caring professors I've had. The material can become challenging near the end of the course, but she's always very welcoming and eager to give extra help during her office hours. Her grading criteria is clear and she gives bonus marks for coming to class and on the midterm! She wants to see all her students succeed.",
      "She's a really nice prof who wants all her students to get A+. Like any other class, if you're even slightly confused then you should seek help to understand since it's all relevant to the later material. She'll always be ready to patiently explain it to you.",
      "Best Prof on Campus!",
      "Make sure to go in for office hours to get concepts explained and your mark wont be under an A.",
      "Very nice profesor, easy to understand",
      "She is the best professor I have come across in my University experience so far. I would give her a 5/5.",
      "A decent, straightforward, and a somewhat lenient professor although there was a noticeable spike in difficulty in the handling of the material towards the end of the course but was able to set things on track at a critical time. Tries to relate to students by telling us life stories around the work the professor did. Just solid overall.",
      "The most helpful prof I've had in my entire uni experience so far. Really wants to see you succeed. If you do your part as a student then you will be rewarded with an amazing mark. The course is not too difficult. Be respectful towards her effort to teach, she'll boost your grade if she sees you participating. It's a fun class, labs are a breeze.",
      "One of the best most helpful professors i've had in my life! Unlike other engineering profs who don't help out, she helped out and was always there for anyone who puts in the time. You will get a good mark if you put in some effort. Just a genuine sweet and nice prof and very kind hearted!",
      "Professor Qi is one of the best professors I have had in all my university years! I have never seen anyone who is there there students as much as her!! She wants everyone to do good, she is willing to go above and beyond to help! She was forced to use slides made by the course coordinator, but its not her fault. Highly recommended!",
      "Super nice! But difficult to understand. Nicest prof ever. textbook PDF available online, make sure you have the right version!",
      "Her passion for her teaching is often overlooked by her still developing teaching skills, however the material was easy enough to learn on your own. I have yet to see a professor who cares as much about their students as she does. Probably the nicest professor/teacher I've had in a long time. Over time you adjust to the accent. 9/10 would recommend",
      "This was easily the best professor I have had in my University experience so far. Very nice and helpful. If you put in the work, you will definitely get a mark you deserve.",
      "This professor was fantastic. Sure, listening to someone read off powerpoints can be dull at times but she makes up for this by how much she cares for her students. Makes sure were well prepared for the midterm and exam, and she's also super helpful in person. 10/10 would recommend.",
      "It's obvious that she really cares about her students. However, she tends to get a bit flustered during the lecture which seems to throw off some students. If she manages to keep her enthusiasm and get more in the rhythm of lecturing, she definitely has the potential to be one of the best profs at uOttawa.",
      "Shes one of the greatest profs in uOttawa. Ridiculously nice and inspirational, go to her office hours and she will literally tell you everything you need to know. Super helpful, her accent can be a little confusing but this doesn't matter cuz she teaches really well and will tell you exactly whats on exams, plus she will even help u write it!",
      "Professor Hao is a reasonable and responsible professor. Not many profs have this quality. She is a very nice person as well. Her main problem would be her accent as pointed out by the other reviewers, meaning she may not be clear during lectures. However, if you have any questions she is definitely there for you! In general, great Prof!",
      "Really nice professor, exams are pretty simple. Taking every lecture, and finishing all assignments, you will pass this course"

      "This course was earlier offered by some other prof. but since 2016 winter, Herna Viktor started teaching the course. She expects the full understanding of the concept and is really good at her own concepts. Assignments were bit confusing but once you understand, they are piece of cake. So is the mid term and final. Easy A if you understand concept.",

The final exam was a LOT harder than expected - luckily, marking was extremely generous, as with every other deliverable in the course including final project.",

      "She's been teaching this course for a while has clearly designed for students to succeed (the one's who put in any sort of effort). If you go to the tuts/labs you'll know everything you'll need to do for the assignments/exams. Worst part of this course were the TA's and how useless they were, but you should be use to that by now.",

      "Although the course is challenging, it is worth taking since you can learn many things. Personally the 2nd exam was really difficult despite I spared more time on studying compared to the 1st exam. Many questions require thorough understanding. Just knowing how to solve specific problem is not good enough. You always have to be one step forward.",

      "She tries her best u can see that, but the assignment marking is brutal.",

After 45 minutes into the exam, he asked a student for my number, called me on my cell phone told me to come do the exam (I thought it'd be the next day) and offered to stay longer to give me more time to finish the exam.

During the whole term, I only got 60 and 76 in two midterm exams, and I felt really bad about my final. But to my surprise int end she gave me a A- as my final grade. Thanks a lot",
      "She's kind and she explained the materials clearly in the lectures. Although she doesn't provide solutions to the exams and assignments, you can ask her questions and she will work with you together for solutions during the office hours.",
      "One of the best professor at uottawa. You should attend the class.",
      "She really goes in detail and covers the topic thoroughly, her lecture is extensive be prepared to take a lot of note and learn a lot of things. She is also helpful and you will always find her in her consulting hours. I was very skeptical about the course since the context seemed very challenging at first but she made it very easy.",

Bonus points available on homework, doing optional presentations, and even for just showing up to presentations! For a graduate course, it was pretty relaxing!",
      "ZzzZzzZzzZzz....Maybe its because I knew all the material from highschool or because she is very quiet and &quot;delicate&quot; sounding but i ended up watching friends on my laptop all year...thats an awesome show btw! Bottom line, not a hard teacher but not the most energetic either.",
      "A nice prof, an easy course. If you have taken any programming course in high school the class material will be very boring. My only complaint is that she is quiet and doesn't control the class when students start to talk, making it hard to hear.",

I actually started enjoying to code after this course.",

He explains WHY we are being taught something from his own experience and from relevant current events. Once you understand why, you become motivated to learn. The brilliance is also in how the relevance is explained. I STRONGLY recommend him.",
      "Very happy I took a course with Omar. Here really made me like and enjoy learning. He directly and indirectly makes the material interesting and relevant. His approach is to make you like the topic, understand why it is important, and then teach it. I feel he genuinely cares.. I simply recommend ANY course with him..",

      "I wish all professors were like Omar. He make us passionate about the subject of the course. He is fun and I enjoy going to each class. He starts off with something interesting and slowly transitions into the topic. The assignments are some what long, but if you do them, then you are pretty much ready for the exams.",
      "Very nice guy, great attitude, funny. Knowledgable, but sometimes a little bit unprepared to present the material. Assignments were on the easy side but they did cover the material, exams were fair, if you know the material you'd do fine. Refreshing to have a prof that doesn't seem to want to trick you or play games.",

      "Really excellent prof. He makes the subject relevant and interesting. I enjoyed almost every lecture. He also seems to really care about the students. He encouraged us to focus on learning rather than focusing on the grades. I would definitely recommend this professor.",
      "Good, honest fellow. You can tell that he is a new professor, which is good and bad at the same time since he isn't the most experienced in this course (Formal languages) but is willing to answer questions and does not have a strong accent. I recommend him over other professors.",
      "Great professor. He makes the course interesting and I learned lot in his course. I strongly recommend this professor.",
      "A great prof! He starts all his lectures off with something funny or interesting, and then transitions that into the day's lecture. Very funny and engaging. Also worked hard to make sure we don't have to spend money we don't have to (ie. money on textbooks. He contacted the publishers for free textbooks. And we got it! Considerate, funny, engaging!"

      "A solid prof who teaches the material really well and puts it all up on bright space, however, some of his assignments are difficult, as well as the midterm and the final exam as they are multiple choice and very tricky. though, he provided some bonus quizzes to help you make up for your score.",
      "Great professor i learned alot",
      "I had a heavy loaded timetable and I almost failed the introduction to computing ITI1120 course. This professor inspired me and keep encouraging until I got A-. One big advice try to participate at his lecture as he memorized names properly. Also, do not forget to enroll at the online coursera offered at his brightspace; those resources helped a lo",
      "A great professor who makes the lectures as engaging and interactive as possible. He is very knowledgeable of Python however, I found his assignments are extremely tough and yea the exams are tricky multiple choices which I am OK with it. Any programming background with basic computational skills make this course a straight A.",
      "a very nice, decent, and helpful Professor. The course material was so prepared and covered every thing @ the text book, I loved his slides.. one minor thing was the assignments were so hard and challenging. Overall the course was great and fun."

      "This is the best programming teacher I've ever had. He really makes you think about what you're doing, and makes you very careful when you code. If you make a mistake, he'll make sure you never make it again. Definitely going to be a memorable course. If you can choose Ashwin as your TA, I definitely recommend.",
      "this man changes the computing game, makes you adore code even if youve never done it before and hes definitely someone to chill with outside of class. hopefully he continues teaching sections",
      "His lectures are fun! I had no experience with coding &amp; learned quite a bit, but I strongly recommend taking advantage of his office hours! Even if you don't have a lot of questions, he's just awesome to chill with. However, I would definitely suggest taking your own notes or supplementing with online info, as his slides are not the best.",

      "Really good guy, but if you haven't coded it can be a bit difficult. He is always available for help and asks for a lot of feedback from students. Very worth it to take his class.",
      "he made the class a enjoyable as it was. Would sit down and have a beer with him any day of the week.",

      "Dr. Anthony Dixon is one of the best professors. I found his lectures very useful as he worked on examples during his lectures. He explained abstract concepts in a very academic and simple way which inspired me to attend his lecture and use his notes. He uploaded his lecture notes, and he spent a lot of time in his office hours when I needed help.",
      "He is a perfect professor. As long as he has time and you find him in the office, he will do everything to help his students even it's not his scheduled office hour.",
      "Assignments and midterms are easy. The final tho, is very very hard. He is nice tho and he scales up the class.",
      "Good lecture notes. Audio notes are available too. There're sample tests online and quite similar to the midterm. He gives you solutions for assignments which is great. Overall he's a good decent prof in CS. The course is hard though but all CMPT courses are hard you know what I mean.",
      "Easy assignments and midterms. But the final is crazy hard. He explains the course material pretty clearly though.",
      "It's a very hard course, but Tony realizes this and does his best to help every student get a good grade. Many profs at SFU pride themselves in making it difficult to get a good grade, but not this prof - he puts many sample exams online to practice on (and the exams are usually very similar) - he makes audio recordings available and all notes too.",
      "Keys to be successful in this course: 1)find a good group mate 2)read the all the notes(every single line) that he posted online! 3)must understand each assignment in order to pass this course",
      "Nice prof and ok explaining skills it's just that the course material is pretty hard. Don't worry his midterms are worth only 10% of total grade while assignments worth 7.5% each(4 assignments in total). He also allows you to replace lab attendance for any assignments u miss.",
      "Best prof ever! But his assignments were tough !",
      "Very friendly and helpful instructor. The difficulty of this course heavily depends on whether or not you regularly go to his office. He posts online notes and audio recordings of each lecture. Tests are hard but not unreasonable. Assignments are easy if you start them early and attend to labs. Everything in the course is well organized.",
      "Wish he offered more courses!!",
      "Best prof in SFU till now. 150 250",
      "Very nice person, always helping us on assignments during office hours.",
      "Tony is the best teacher for this class. Attendance is a must as he does various examples on the overhead and explains them. Does not use powerpoint which is a good thing for this course. Assignments are tough but you do learn a lot.",
      "Teaches information very clearly. Once you understand his teaching style and the basics, the class is very easy. Textbook was totally unnecessary. Great prof",
      "Tony is the best the teacher in SFU. He knows how to teach and work very hard. He is very helpful either in his office or through email. He will explains more than your question. He loves students. Hope he can teach more years before retires.",
      "awesome prof!!!!!!",
      "He is one of the few good profs at SFU. Very knowledgeable, clear, and detailed explanations, always available to help students. If you have a choice, take the course with him! Until now, I think he is the best prof at SFU.",
      "By far my most enjoyable class of the semester. His lectures are extremely useful, just write down and listen to what he says and you will be golden. Textbook is not necessary with him, he even posts notes at the end of the week with everything you need to know. Assignments were fun and exams weren't hard if you just pay attention to lecture.",
      "One of the best profs in SFU computing science. I took both cmpt 150 and 250 with him. Exams are a little bit hard, but if you attend the lectures and able to do his assignments you will find no difficulties. Over all superb, but grading is little bit harsh.",
      "His notes are superb. Assignments are not easy but office hours will help a lot. If you want to take CMPT 150 and 250, he is the guy.",
      "Great professor! Extremely knowledgeable; nobody ever asked a question he couldn't answer. Ready to help students, even staying overtime in his office hours to help a line of students. His lectures are very detailed, and his explanations are very clear. He prepares you well for exams, and the marking is fair.",
      "He is one of the most smartest professor in sfu. if you attend his class every day, you will get your satisfied grade",
      "Best prof at SFU",
      "He's one of the best CS prof you can meet in the department. I love his class. He's really nice too. Though the materials aren't exactly what you might call the easiest stuff, but he always tries his best to explain. Love it! I was reminded of the Santa Clause... Well, in a way XD",
      "Dixon's voice is a bit monotone but his clarity and concept explanations are top notch. Textbook is not needed at all, just make sure to attend every lecture and copy down everything he writes. Assignments and tests are not easy but they are fair so study hard and put in a good amount of effort. Definitely recommend taking his courses.",
      "I don't usually rate on ratemyprof but when I do, I mean it. A+ for this prof. :)",
      "Barely opened the textbook & never missed a lecture, because his lectures & online class notes are clear, organized, and all you need to know. Assignments were long, but fun & informative. Very helpful, considerate, & thorough when asked questions in person or via email. Warning: he makes typos, so if you think you're right, speak up.",
      "Gives thorough lectures, and gave weekly lecture summaries online. I thought the tests, and assignments were fair.",
      "I have to say that I have a lot of respect for his knowledge and class. Assignments are long but do them, you will learn a lot, especially if you have to take ENSC 350. Final exam is hard. But do you self a favor and take the CMPT 250 with him. You will never regret if you take it with him",
      "clearest lecture i've ever attended, you just can't help but listen to him carefully. exams & assignements are generally not difficult and closely related to what's taught in class. helpful after class too.",
      "I just want to say: He is the man to be respected!",
      "Great prof!! lecture notes are very helpful",
      "Excellent prof, engaging and clear about the systems we're working with. Go to his office for help and you will leave with a complete understanding of the answer.",
      "The course is hard, but he is the most helpful prof i've ever had! Extremely nice :) Go to his office and you will never get into trouble with assignment or exam!",
      "This is a challenging course, but Dixon's extremely helpful office hours and his crystal clear notes make this a walk in the park. He works through examples in lecture similar to what's been assigned. Definitely recommended.",
      "Definitely one of the best professors I have ever had. His voice may seem a bit monotone, but if you're interested in the material, you'll stay awake. EVERY single day he has covered every detail of his lecture with perfect clarity. He even gives examples that run parallel to the assignments, so you should never hit a &quot;road block&quot; in this course.",
      "I took his CMPT 150 class and had a really hard time having little previous knowledge, but he was so willing to help and so approachable I learned a ton. Took 250 from him and did even better. Definitely recommend taking his class over 150/250 w/ Atousa, you will learn some assembly which is expected later but is not taught in her equiv ensc course",
      "Wonderful prof. Labs are fairly easy/straightforward, assignments are a bit harder but not impossible, but exams is where you really have to pay attention to details. Highly recommended for cmpt 150/250",
      "Weekly labs are easy (attendance not mandatory) but assignments are time consuming and hard. Midterms and final were average - easier than expected. Just study his notes and labs and you'll be fine.",
      "Dist Ed: If you've taken any other programming course before, this course will be easy. Nonetheless, you'll learn plenty of VB tools to work with. Final exam was very short (literally four functions)",
      "Labs were easy, assignments were hard. You WILL need to study for MT and final, because they are extremely hard. However, he's an extremely good prof w/ good notes. Highly recommended for cmpt150/250 because you'll learn alot.",
      "If it wasn't for the excellent TA, I might have failed the course. For Dixon's class, you need to interact with either the TA or the prof. Dixon is very helpful only if you talk to him. Warning: very hard tests, assignments, AND labs",
      "This guy has THE best notes ever. He explains everything, and answers every single question. Assignments and tests were LONG and HARD, but still do-able. He'll answer all your questions if you ask him. One thing thou: his voice is too soft and monotone, so it can get a bit boring.",
      "Great prof. Good lectures and even better notes, however that means in no way that the class is a breeze (CMPT250). Good voice, encourages questions, nice guy overall and to top it off hes got a sweet beard. Solid. Solid.",
      "his only problem is that his voice is too soft that makes ppl to go to sleep. but other than that, he's one of the nicest prof in sfu.",
      "Covers material very fast, have to keep up. Good assignments - tend to take a lot of time.",
      "Tough class, don't do macm in distance ed. Dr. Dixon's assignments were extremely difficult, as was his final.",
      "Good prof, but be prepared if you're taking CMPT 150 or 250 with Dixon; assignments are EXTREMELY difficult and will take many hours (or days!) to complete. Exams are decent. Notes are really great, but he doesn't post them online so go to class! He is very helpful and often stays after class to answer students' questions.",
      "prepares good lectures. sometimes you cannot concentrate on lecture materials just because he sometimes goes too fast. super nice prof. TAs mark the exams easy. able to see final exam after grades are posted (just email him). prepares good notes",
      "The course is difficult for those without prior experience, as the learning curve is logarithmic. Don't fall behind or else it's game over. Software isn't free, so it's hard to work at home. Don't take with other hard courses.",
      "A true professor. Well organized and clear. Very approachable and available to help...",
      "Excellent prof! Exams are fair, lectures are clear! OFfer a lot of help to students~ Assignments are tedious but do-able. Learned a lot from him.",
      "Although I am really bad at computing and my grade is not good, I want to say, he is a good prof.",
      "I suggest people should take cmpt 250 with this prof. You will learn alot from him. His lecture notes are very clear and useful, but his exams are extremely hard. Assignments are hard and long, you have no time to sleep if you want to finish the assignments on time",
      "Assignments take 8-24 hours each. The prof can help out a lot if you seek help in person. If you wanna stay awake in lectures, bring a case of Red Bull.",
      "Excellent prof, but exams are hard; assignments are doable but require a good deal of time and effort.",
      "At the first glance, he's a very organized prof. The notes more clear than other CMPT classes. However, do NOT be fooled this class is easy! The notes do NOT adequetely prepare you for the asns and exams, and they look MUCH harder(although they should NOT). You need to SELF STUDY a lot, and it'll cost you BIG TIME if you are too busy w/ MACM!",
      "Very helpful and clear prof. His assignments are more challenging than the exams. The fact is, he is not a difficult prof (consider the potential difficulty of the course), it is the material that is difficult.",
      "Wonderful prof whose notes are very easy to understand... Very helpful!",
      "Monotone voice which is boring. Extremely good with his material, takes it very seriously, classy guy, little sense of humor.",
      "Notes are well organized. Lectures are clear, although it seems boring.(Notes are posted online later) There's a lot to learn in the class, but parts of the assignments are disappointly HARD! Mixed feelings - The prof is great, but again the marks, ...",
      "He is so elegant that can't be described in words. Not only is he a great professor, he is a real man that hardly can be found in our era. He is always glad to help and never let students to be disappointed. He posts his neatly prepared lecture notes on the website. He is really a gret SENIOR LECTURER as his title specifies.",
      "Very good prof. He might be a bit monotone lecturing but he's very organized, and does a excellent job presenting complex info in a clear manner. You learn a lot in his class. Assignments are hard but he prepares you well for them. Exams are easy compared to assignments and grading is fair. Gives option to drop midterm if you do poorly on midterms",
      "nice use of the english language...willing to clarify what is not understood in lectures and assignments...fair exams, grading, and grade assignment (curving)...fair but hard exams...",
      "Good prof.His notes are the BEST. In his office hours,you can ask many question you want, and it doesn't matter how many times you don't understand the concept, he will repeat it until you got it :)Assignments are pretty helpful and difficulty is &quot;so so&quot;. Midterms & Finals are easy if you study.I prefer this prof to everyone who needs to take CMPT.",
      "hard, boring, but still knows his**** and is still a good prof",
      "One of the best Prof I have ever met in the computing scicenc. Strong recommend to take his cmpt150. Organization is very good, teaching is very good. He is very patient and always try to help students.",
      "One of the best professor around, extremely helpful. Make sure u take him if he's teaching this course",
      "Despite the difficult midterms and finals, he's very helpful and carries a positive attitude towards students. The lectures are boring, but you really can't blame due to a lack of interesting course material.",
      "Final is hard as hell, but the prof is a great guy.",
      "Such a fun and interesting class! One of the best CMPT teachers I've had at SFU. Final was tricky, but he really cares about his students. Will go the extra mile to help you.",
      "Read others' compliments about his teaching. I just want to mention that usually we rarely see Santa Claus type of people with his hotness. He is so energetic - we couldn't catch up with him when rushing into the classroom one day. Hot and cute type! Try!",
      "Very helpful and kind man. Always willing to stay those extra 15minutes to make sure you understand something... plus he's like a santa clause/ sean connery hybrid.",
      "He is one of the best cmpt prof in SFU compares to other prof that is teaching cmpt 150. He cares about students and willing to asnwer any questions you have. Even though you think the questions are dumb.",
      "He's one of the best teachers. Assignments and midterms are hard. Final is not easy. =) But he's very helpful during his office hours and willing to answer as many questions as you have. He always gives students extra hours after the regular office hours.",
      "Also take CMPT 150 under him too. His tests might be tough; but his lecture are very clear. He is pretty patient to answer all questions the students has. As long as you have understand the concepts; you will have no problem at all.",
      "First of all, Cmpt 150 has never been easy and never will be. Dixon is doing a good job compared to others and is fair too. Yet, don't forget to check if there are good TA's as they have a very important role in this course.",
      "brilliant lecturer. but made first year 150 harder than some of my second/third year courses.",
      "He knows what he is doing. He has a good knowledge in computing science. But he not a good teacher. He does not try to clarify stuff. He just assume you understand and keeps on going to new materials. Tough assinments.",
      "helpful notes, tough assignments, easy exams and nice man. u will get a good grade if u've done all he wants u to do. but i don't know why, i always fall asleep during his class. ^^",

She was available for extra help outside of class, and there was a decent amount of assignments. You could tell that she really wants her students to do their best, and to succeed!",
      "Great prof, clear material explanation. Super responsible",
      "She is an awesome professor. She really seems to care that you learn. The course is seriously an easy A if you bother to go to class, listen and follow her instructions on assignments. She gives a lot of free marks. We had 2% for attending a workshop and 1% extra credit. Exams and assignments are easy. What more do you want?! Def recommend her!",
      "Great Professor, very enthusistic on the course and very caring as well. Cares about having her students succeed. Would definitely take a course with her again.",
      "Great prof! She is very sweet and caring. Her assignments are a little challenging but that is how you learn. Her lectures are great too!",
      "Wonderful professor. Friendly and approachable, knowledgeable and passionate about the course material and stays after class to answer questions and help out students. Would gladly take another course with Diana.",
      "Diana is one of the sweetest people you will ever meet! She really cares about her students and uses visual demonstrations that really help in understanding the material. The concepts are easy to understand but the tests are all a little tricky so be prepared! Knowing some Python beforehand will significantly help.",
      "Diana is so caring and sweet! She does a well job explaining concepts and puts in a lot of effort to make sure you actually learn! It is clear that she is passionate about teaching and knows a lot about cs! and she is happy to adjust grades and extend deadlines if students inform her :)",
      "She was super caring and always listened to the class. Even when we did bad on the midterm, she was very receptive and helped us improve. Would definitely take a course with her again.",
      "Best prof you could have for this course. Extremely caring, she really wants every student to do well.",
      "I am surprised to see why doesn't have a rating of 4.5+. She teaches in an excellent manner that really makes you understand how your code works. No question is a stupid question in her class, she welcomes extra inquiries and slowly goes over anything you do not understand. She waits outside the class for some time if you have any quick questions. Her notes are organized and she posts the annotated notes online after the class (bless her!). Read over the notes before quiz/test and understand all the iClicker questions and the concepts. That's all you need to good on the exam. Don't forget to practice a lot. There are some websites that let you practice your python skills. She lets you use generous amounts of cheat-sheets so do not stress the exams. Remember Practice is all you need to get A+ in this course.",
      "Lectured well, easy to understand. She is very caring to students, and replied to questions on e-mail and is easily accessible outside of lectures. Would take a class with her again!",
      "Diana is very kind, passionate and caring. She enjoys teaching. Her lectures and labs are useful for the assignments and exams.",
      "I loved her teaching, although it gets a little annoying when she teaches from the ground up and it feels a bit too immature, she explains very well and she is really nice. If you take her courses, be sure to pay lots of attention to her lab exercises and you will do great.",
      "Kind and enthusiastic. It's okay if you don't have coding experience because she makes it accessible for beginners. My TA didn't care what we did in labs - just show up 5 out of 11 times. Tests consists of MC and handwriting code. MC qs were actually quite hard and similar to iclicker qs. I wanted to sleep through some lectures...",
      "Great prof",
      "She's the nicest person ever, and REALLY doesn't want to see anyone do poorly. She makes a very easy Python based course even easier with a lot of free questions on exams and bonus marks everywhere.",

      "Definitely a great professor, good teaching style. She's patient and helpful, would take her course in the future.",
      "Felt that she tried to cram too much material into one semester. Lots of guest speakers. Assignments aren't too hard but sometimes need clarifying. You can tell she's very passionate about the subject and teaching CMPT in general. She genuinely wants everyone to learn and do well, and is very open to suggestions.",
      "Quirky, and very knowledgeable. Enjoyed her teaching style, did not enjoy the 3 hours of lecture after the hour of tutorial that was mandatory for the class.",
      "Pros: Very helpful and friendly. Supports you throughout the course with small things here and there. Simplifies concepts; beginner-friendly. Cons: Somewhat disorganized, not always clear.",
      "Great professor! She is very helpful and kind especially if you go to her office hours. If you study her notes and DO all the practice questions and labs, her exams are very easy and you get a cheat sheet. Last assignment was long. Will for sure take a course with her again! Iclicker points in class count for marks which is my only complaint.",
      "Fantastic introductory professor. It may seem that the material is trivial, but she really does set you up with a great foundation for future computer science courses.",
      "Diana IS very sweet - she tries to engage the class and is just very nice. However, I did find her lectures and even the tests disorganized. In fact, her assignments were very unclear (way too long-winded, was confusing), but it's just a language thing. Beware of office hour lineups! She will explain for a long time, which causes traffic. )",
      "The class is not hard to begin with but she is simply the sweetest woman, who just really wants her students to enjoy and succeed in the class.",
      "Diana is a great ComSci prof! Lectures were very clear and easy to understand,even though it is quite clear English is probably not her first language. Every assignment was quite interesting, and the online Peerwise system was a good tool for learning from classmates. Great help was always available in her office hours. TA's however were not great.",
      "Diana is a really nice and approachable prof. She really does care about her students and does her best to make everyone pass. CMPT is a subject that you need to spend time on especially if you have no programming background but overall this class is easy. Just spend sometime with the material and get help if you need it.",
      "Diana is a super nice prof. She cares about students and she can explain the concepts really well. Office hours is helpful, assignments and exams are fair. She even gave me extension on an assignment because I was going through some tough family issues. I took 2 courses with her and wish I could take more!",
      "Diana was a great professor. Her quizzes and exams are tough, so make sure you are doing the coursework. Her lectures are great because she gives analogies for simplifying some of the rather abstract details of the material. She's a super nice prof! Go to class and do the work and you'll be sailing.",
      "Amazing!",
      "I thought I will failed the course because three of my on class exams got so much lower than class average. maybe I did really good in the final, finally got B+. lab assignment + group assignment are cues to midterm & final coding part. wonderful and nice profI highly recommend her class.",
      "Although this was a recommended Q and B-Sci course for Art students, I really struggled in the class. The concepts were simple, but the wording and explanations confused me, especially on the tests. The tests compared to labs and assignments were too advanced. Not enough time and needed to write code on paper. She's super nice, but confusing.",
      "She's the sweetest prof ever, always there for the students. Her lectures can be pretty confusing as she tends to jump around between subjects a lot. If you have a programming background this class is an easy A if not be prepared to really work hard to fully understand concepts. Her tests and assignments aren't too hard.",
      "Diana will always take the time to explain something to you if you don't understand. She is friendly and encourages students to come to her after class if they don't understand. The i-clickers are CONSTANT and the quizzes are very confusing (write code with pen and paper- annoying) but overall the lecture notes are great and she uses good examples.",
      "Diana is one of the best profs to take 150 with, she is great at explaining concepts and her notes are stellar! Very easy to follow. She engages you in class (doesnt pick on people, she asks questions to engage) & her assignments/exams were helpful and fair overall (you still need to study). Very dedicated & helpful professor - highly recommend.",
      "By far one of the nicest profs at SFU. If you like the holding hand, she is the one.",
      "An exceptionally helpful professor. Even for an introductory class, she makes it a total breeze and allows cheat sheet for the midterms/finals. Exams are fair, if you studied you will be fine. No questions out of the ordinary. Assignments tedious but very helpful and good practice. Shes super helpful even during exams! Ask her questions! Great prof",
      "Super nice prof, really has enthusiasm for the course & cares about her students. Some concepts she explains very well using slides, diagrams, human model examples, etc. At other times her explanations can lack clarity. Course may be hard to people who have no programming background, since free online textbook can be vague",
      "Nice professor as others have said, but her email responses come off as a bit rude.",
      "Diana is a Saint. \"Cookie Woman\", a nickname coined for her, sums her up perfectly, as she is sweet caring and devoted to her students. At first she may come off as unprofessional but she quickly makes up for it by making concepts clear and easy for everyone. I personally did not use the FREE textbook at all, but she does reference it occasionally.",
      "Diana has to be one of the nicest, most helpful professors I have met. She really cares about how her students do and you learn a lot about Java and useful programming techniques. Class is a moderate workload and she's very accommodating when there are problems with getting assignments in. Explanations of concepts are also clear and understandable.",
      "Diana is such a helpful professor and really goes out of her way to fix any problems you have/answer questions. She posts all her slides with her writing on them so you can just listen and understand during the lectures. Cheat Sheets are allowed during tests but don't rely on them as you won't have time to find answers. Lots of bonus marks given!",
      "Diana is awesome! I learned so much about java from her. An easy A+ too. Things to note: you won't be taking notes in her lectures as they are largely slides based. Don't buy the text book, You'll do just fine with her notes and stack overflow etc. Do the lab assignments and it should be a piece of cake! Truly a caring prof, one of SFU's finest.",
      "She is hands down one of the most caring profs at SFU. You will see early on that she tries her best to make sure that the course flows smoothly and everything is fair and well. Her assignments and projects may be long but it's a good learning experience. Also, she gives many bonus points! She is one of my favourite profs at SFU so far.",
      "She was very helpful and a nice prof. Very reasonable and takes a personal interest with students, sure she takes a long time with each individual but she makes sure you understand the material. Gives many bonus marks. Midterms/Exam was long but she acknowledges that and takes it into account when giving out grades.",
      "great prof. very kind and helpful! LOVE HER!",
      "A very friendly prof. Gives a lot of bonus marks which are worth about 0.1% each of total grade. Avoid office hours if possible because she takes forever with each student so you will not get through unless you are first in line.",
      "This prof is very friendly and easy going. loves to teach and will help all her students! on the other hand, her midterms are extremely long and hard. only a few questions but you barely have time to finish them. and her projects are super long and hard! Your basically at her office every day for help. hint: find a SMART lab parnter!!",
      "Reasonable prof. What can I say&#63; Programming is logic. If you can think logically then you are good to go. If you can complete a long assignment then you are even better off.",
      "Good prof. Really cares about her students. Won't kill your GPA, but likely you'll have long assignments and attendance will be mandatory. Overall, I'd say her helpful-ness makes up for the work. Recommended.",
      "Do not take 126 if you have never done programming before.The course content was much harder than 120, but Diana was super helpful and caring. After bombing on the midterm and final, I still ended up with an A. The 2 projects might take a lot of time(but its easy to get perfect because of bonus points).",
      "Nicest Prof I ever had! Got more than 100% on final exam (if a lot of ppl screw up on a question she either makes it a bonus, or omits it) Although I had programming experience, looking at her slow pace and helpfulness, I dont see why beginners should have any probz...esp if they find a smart partner for the Labs/Projs!",
      "BEST CS prof imo. Allows cheat sheet, excellent online notes, great explainations, care for students, replies quick to emails. Learned ALOT from her. 2 long projects in semester, and most labs are 'exploratory'. You can partner up with a buddy to split the work for the project. MT and Final were fairly long, but really easy if you can do projects.",
      "She allows cheat sheets on her tests, and is overall a very fun teacher to be with. Very easy course, yet I learned alot from her. There WILL be mini-tests every now and then, and although you don't have to attend lectures to get the material, you should still go in case of mini-tests =] Overall a really great prof",
      "projects are too hard too much work",
      "One of the best ComSci profs there is. The thing that stands out most is her genuine care for her students. She will teach you until you understand it. Take any course with her if you can - especially in the 100 and 200 level courses. She makes sure you have a good foundation for high level courses. MT and Final are fair if you do your homework.",
      "Diana is by far one of the best profs I've had thus far at SFU. Like others have said, the course can be challenging for people with no programming experience, but Diana is always willing to help her students. She emails the class regularly in case people have missed lecture, which is quite handy. Cares greatly for her students.",
      "This course is really hard if you have no prior programming experience. Prof is good but assignments/projects are tricky. TAs do not give you enough attention.",
      "Like others have said, a very nice prof. Looks out for her students. An easy course for those with programming experience, otherwise, it can be hard for beginners.",
      "Great prof! Very friend and helpful.",
      "Great, energetic prof, very interesting to listen to in lecture. If she notices the class is tired, she'll get everyone to get up and stretch! She clearly cares a lot about her students. Go to lectures, pay attention, try new things. Even with no prior programming experience I still got an A+ entering the final.",
      "well, she is a super nice prof who really CARES about her students,,the lab exercises are important and relevant to midterms and projects. the only problem is that people who are good at programming will absolutely do well while those who are not familiar with coding will be suffering for a while,,Overall, the prof is excellent!!",
      "She's really cool. At first I thought lectures were a waste of time, but afterwards I realized how much effort she put into it and started going. She's clearly very helpful and cares about students. Always looking out for students (eg extensions)",
      "Very fun and easy teacher. Midterms are easy as long you understand the material. Two large projects took alot of time, but very manageable. Great lectures, and you can tell that she cares for the students very much. Overall, great professor",
      "Great prof, really connects with the students in class. notes are a bit messy and sometimes makes some mistakes but tells us right away via email. labs aren't too difficult, assignments are long and require some time but definitely doable. MT was fair. offers lots of help for students. definitely recommended",
      "She's awesome with her hilarious Uruguayan accent! Great professor, especially for such an unpleasant subject.",
      "She was a great prof to have, very helpful and clear notes. Exams were fair. Assignments were a bit long but she explains material well enough for you to do a decent job.",
      "HAHA, A LOT OF FUN",
      "I love her! very clear teaching, but too many projects killed our time and effort... Midterms are fair",
      "She's really helpful and teaches the material well enough for beginners to understand. Highly recommended for anyone who needs to take CMPT classes.",
      "The model professor. Clear, concise, and super nice! I failed first midterm, but after talking to Diana and listening to her lectures everything became crystal clear. I ended up getting B+.",
      "definitely a nice prof. cares about students + mark easy",
      "Diana's very nice (she even told us she would not be offended if we fell asleep in her class). Unfortunately when she taught us 310 it ended up covering almost entirely Prolog and she gave maybe 30 minutes each to some other fundamental AI like neural networks.",
      "She has lovely smile. Unlike other Profs, she's always for extra office hour and extra help.",
      "She really cares about what she's teaching, and she's clear about it. The course is very easy, most-of-which is because she does a solid lecture. There are times when the course drags, though.",
      "a really nice prof. unlike most University ppl who are filled w/ themselves & their authority, she is very real; the type of person that just loves constant learning & gaining deep insights. she is also passionate w/ teaching the course & imparting her understanding to us.",
      "Wonderful prof. She's obviously very excited and passionate about her work. She's very knowlegbe, at least on the subject of JAVA, and easily accessible for help. She's also quite understanding and leanient on handing in assingments.",
      "helpful and friendly. her lectures seemed somewhat chaotic though.",
      "Wow what an excellent prof. She will wake up at 3 am just to email everyone helpful tips to finishing assignments. The assignments are fair and well spaced out through the term. Her teaching method is good and I learned lots from the course. I recommend taking macm with her.",
      "She is very clear and very nice. The Assignments may appear difficult,but the midterm and final are way easier than the assignments...",
      "Simply one of the best. I have never had a Proff that i actually felt that they wanted me to do good. she is super nice and attentive. the material is hard but she ellaborates it very well. exams are a bit tight on time but very fair! in total - my favorite!",
      "She's a very nice prof. Her notes are decent, and the assignments/exams were straightforward (no surprises).",
      "Good prof. Very easy to understand.",
      "Very well thought out teaching style. Provided a broad background of the subject and used many invited speakers to compliment her lectures. One of the best CMPT profs at SFU!",
      "Great Prof."

      "Bobby is a well Respected Prof and is very clear when it comes to explaining,his notes were sometimes messy but it wasn't that much of a Problem, Very good professor except for the long time it took to mark assignments (a month and a half for assignments haha)",
      "CAN I GIVE HIM 10 OUT OF 5",
      "the best teacher ever!",
      "The project is a hit or miss depending on your group. I unfortunately had a bad group which required me to complete the entire project practically by myself. The exams are based off the slides and you'll probably get away with not attending lectures.",
      "hes amazing and super nice. cares about your future and also kind of funny no suprises. gives it how it is.",
      "Great prof, detailed notes!",
      "Best prof ever!",
      "Best professor I've ever had. I had him for both MACM 101 and CMPT 125. Don't take those courses with anyone else if you have the option of taking it with Bobby. He's super helpful and explains everything very clearly. Although his tests can be quite tough, he is always there for you to help you prepare. Wholesome guy.",
      "Bobby's first time teaching MACM 101. His lectures are very clear and concise. He goes very in depth on counting(VERY IMPORTANT) and FOCUSES mostly on applications rather than theory. His two midterms are a bit too easy in comparison with other profs BUT his final exam was HARD. If you're a first year, prepare to study A LOT. Especially for finals!",
      "A really nice prof.",
      "Bobby is a legend among the CMPT profs at SFU. His lovely smile really compliments his teaching style! But be careful! Behind his smile is a really nasty midterm that will make sure you never took his course! xD",
      "He is a really great teacher, yet the subject is heavy! His lectures are great, but I recommend to do problems from problem set as they are similar to those on quizzes and exams!!",
      "Bobby is the best! The in class assignment is very helpful.",
      "Great prof, explains stuff well and is available outside of class too help. Would recommend.",
      "It's very helpful to review lecture slides thoroughly and come to every class. If you miss a class, you probably will be fairly behind. Cue cards definitely help to remember theorems and remember to practice implementing the data structures and algorithms discussed.",
      "Great prof, cares about students. Office hours extremely helpful!",
      "Final Question is kinda hard. Make sure you work for it. His questions pattern are way different than in class notes. Unfortunately his notes not helpful.",
      "Highly recommended, he is very kind and helpful, he explains material very clearly. Exams were hard, you really need to know the material well.",
      "Bobby is one of my favourites! He's so nice, cracks jokes, non-aggressive, very good at answering questions and doesn't continue the lecture unless you understand his answers. Although he doesn't make his own notes, he's good at relaying material to students. The class was a pleasure to take. Almost everyone loves him.",
      "Bobby is a really nice guy who knows his stuff and will explain things to you again if you come in for office hours. The only complaint I have is the manner in which he gave assignments. All assignments were given out way before the material was covered in lecture and sometimes he only finished covering that material 2 days before it was due.",
      "The course is meant to challenge you and you are expected to learn concepts on your own time. Fortunately, his lectures prepare you well enough to have resources to solve the assignment problems. The assignments are often vague but contacting him, he clarifies. Note that the exams are not difficult so long as you understand every piece of material.",
      "A great teacher and really respected by students. The stuff that he teaches is not easy but the way that he teaches is so clear that he makes it easy to understand.",
      "Bobby is super willing to help his students and explains material very clearly. But he's disorganised. Questions were sloppily written, assignments were unclear, and I wonder whether he even reviewed the slides (borrowed from another prof) before lecture. He made the exams and assignments easier as the course went on because averages were low.",
      "One of the best professor ever! Take it and you won't regret it!",
      "Extremely helpful during office hours and lectures are clear and straight forward. Would take another Computing course with this professor. Wish the administration would make him a complete faculty lecturer instead of a limited term one.",
      "Best prof ever, he genuinely cares about his students. Take him!",
      "Very nice professor, best teacher that I ever met. Hope he has CMPT128 next semester.",
      "He really knows how to explain his stuff. If you ask a question in class, he will answer it and make sure you understand it.",
      "Just enjoy his lectures.",
      "Nice clear prof! I really wished he'd upload his notes though.",
      "Bobby is a great professor, any help you need, he will give it. He's mostly pretty clear in lecture. The course I found to be very difficult, thankfully it's the last one of its kind I have to take to get a CMPT minor. You absolutely need to attend lecture because the textbook is useless.",
      "Bobby is a very nice guy. His friendly demeanor makes him very approachable inside and outside of lecture. He is very organized with good notes that you print out and follow along with in lecture. His midterms are pretty easy. Overall, a very good professor. Be warned, CMPT 150 itself is not a fun course, but Bobby makes it bearable.",
      "Best prof ever no kidding. He is very helpful, email him if you got any questions.",
      "Very friendly, cute, nice, the best professor ever got during 3 years in University so far",
      "great prof I had even met",
      "The best prof in sfu!",
      "He is cute. Lecture clearly.",
      "Great Prof",
      "Great teacher, nice explain,and try to give you high grade. he is your good choice.",
      "Modest prof.",
      "It has been a privilege taking Bobby's CMPT course. He is super helpful and encouraging, so no one hesitates to ask questions in his class! Also, I like his smile which makes him more friendly-looking and approachable. The textbook was nearly useless. I used it only for practice questions. He is definitely one of the best profs you can take in SFU.",
      "Super young but super inspirational professor! He's working on his PhD in Theoretical Comp Sci and what he's teaching (MACM101 and CMPT150's course content) is also what he loves doing the most. He also has a very nice way of lecturing and appears to be very helpful and understanding of students' problems.",
      "Teaches very very well, and clears doubts if a need arises. If you can take his class, please take it! And hes super cute too!",
      "Teaches very very well, and clears doubts if a need arises. If you can take his class, please take it! And hes super cute too! <3",
      "Great prof, responds to feedback, actually cares about students. Material for this course is boring and dry though.",
      "BEST PROF HANDS DOWN! Clear, understandable and helpful. Would definitely recommend taking courses with this prof.",
      "He is the best prof ever!I love him! he is cute too.material isn't that easy, require lots of thinking! He is so good at teaching that I can learn most from him! I went to his office hour every week, I didn't need to study too much before finals. I was very relaxed before final. Definitely recommended! We love Bobby Chan!",
      "Best Teacher I Have Ever Studied From. Great Verbal Skills, Helps Understand The Concept With Utmost Ease. Would Recommend Everyone To Take The Course From Him If He Is An Option.",
      "Recommended to print notes for lectures. Had a hard time following what was going on because I prefer writing notes from scratch, but once I started printing them, lectures became less painful. He goes very fast & it's difficult to decipher his notes afterwards. He's got excellent verbal explanations though. Doesn't give much practice material",
      "best cmpt prof i met so far.in last day lecture, everyone stand up and applaud for him.strongly recommand to take everything with him.",
      "Very friendly, caring and nice. But tests are disaster. Class average around 60% for midterm and final - midterm worth20% and final worth50%.",

      "Note is clear, you can download the powerpoint from his webpage. Attending the lecture is useful as he write down key note on the powerpoint during lecture and those note will be covered in exam",
      "He is excellent and extremely helpful! :)",

      "If he could teach all my cmpt courses, I wouldn't hav to use ratemyprofs.com ever again!! Dont be fooled by his age, although he's a student himself I think&#63;, he was an excellent prof who explained the topics and information well. He used slides to teach 150 and gave relevant exmples in lecture. His midterms were fair and based on exactly whatwas"

      "His lecture is amazing with perfect-organized slides. He shows everything step by step using a nice example(personly think an example is much more helpful than theorem), so you could understand even if you have no base.",
      "You can tell by the way he presents himself in class and speaks with enthusiasm that he loves what he does. His method of delivering lectures is phenomenal and encourages questions in order to be crystal clear. His jokes lighten up the class and maintains a very welcoming atmosphere. I wish he taught every CMPT class offered at burnaby and surrey!",
      "went into 125 knowing nothing extra and came out very confident with the material. His lectures get boring really quickly, and it's easy to miss details if you don't pay attention. I found his assignments very meaningful, so take the time to do them and don't rush them. Exams were very fair and based on the material and assignments.",
      "Can't say enough good things about him. Awesome teacher, and just an awesome person in general.",
      "He is good at explaining things and his notes are crystal clear and covers everything you need (you don't even need to come to class as long as you read his slides). However the assignments and midterm are quite tricky and he gives quite a lot of assignments compared to other profs.",
      "Had him for the joint CMPT 125 and 127 class, really straight forward and fair exams, just make sure you know how the all the algorithms work (visualization) and the rest is easy.",
      "If perfection were human and had a British accent, John would be it. He is a fantastic lecturer who makes the class truly enjoyable. John's explanations make total sense and he is dedicated to helping students.",
      "Easy final exam (the average was crazzzyyy high). His posted notes covered everything on the exams. Assignment were straightforward. Labs were never for any marks, yay! Would totally like to have this guy again.",
      "John is an awesome prof with a great sense of humour! the funny thing about him is he never adds your name after the \"hi\" when he emails you back. 166 is hard for me since i have no interest in this material and this is just mandatory if joint major. anyhow John is funny and very willing to help. highly recommended lecturer!",
      "Great Prof! His lectures are excellent.",
      "He is an excellent professor... very helpful and his notes are just awesome! No need to go through any book, though he recommends one! He explains really well in class as well as his office hours.",
      "One of the best teacher at SFU. His class is well organized: great lectures (you are learning great programming skill), good notes (but don't miss lectures!), good labs (content of labs are rich). Assignments and exams are challenging but if you follow lectures+labs and spend enough time, no need to worry to much about them. Just enjoy learning!!",
      "He has interest in the course. Helps students, read his slides thoroughly if you want to get an A+. His slides are easy to understand but can be misleading if you dont attend the lectures. For midterms, many questions with little time to answer so start with those that you know. Assignments take so much time to complete, so start early.",
      "A easy and useful course in CS.",
      "His slide are f**king good, and he is the best teacher around!!! Top funny guy in SFU ~",
      "In all my four years at SFU, John Edgar is honestly the BEST teacher of any class I've ever taken. He has a genuine interest in the subject, a great sense of humour and his lectures are extremely helpful. I was abysmal at all things computer-science, and now it all makes perfect sense. Do yourself a favour and take his a class with John Edgar.",
      "this guy is the BOMB! Seriously, he's great. Lectures are never boring. Assignments are long and challenging, but well worth the work. The last part of the assignment (hardest part) is usually worth very little, only for the students that go for the A+'s",
      "funny and extremely helpful~good prof...but honestly,i do not recommend people who have no programming background to take this course!",
      "Amazing Prof...Very funny guy..will keep you interested by making fun of him self and bringing in mods of games he has coded. Very Helpful and material is not too tough...one of the best cmpt courses i have taken for sure",
      "Such a nice guy, extremely helpful. good sense of humor and of course, a good teacher.",
      "His slide are crazie good, and he is the best teacheer around.......!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
      "The man, even though he screws up, makes fun of the fact he screwed up and keeps going. got to enjoy it!",
      "Wacky humour is good. Accent is fun. With previous experience in programming, I find his labs a snap, but people around me are floundering. He should be teaching higher level students- he doesn't quite know how to handle people who are clueless about programming.",
      "The best professor I have ever had. Do take classes with him you won't regret it.",
      "Summer semester, Surrey campus. Extremely helpful - writes lengthy documents to help us understand, beneficial to those who actually ask for help. Got my first A+ in programming!",
      "A very good teaching style. Agreed that this class is more difficult that Comp Sci majors will have you believe, though. Does he remind anyone else of Pete Townsend&#63;",
      "Gotta love that A-",
      "He is nice, but expects too high for the students and apprently he doesn't realize that what he's teaching is INTRODUCTION to VB. If you don't have any VB background, be prepared to drop the course. Notes are useless....and assignments are EXTREMELY MEAN!",

      "The course covers a lot of content and the assignments are very long. But the prof is great, he explains things very thoroughly in the lectures. I learned a lot.",
      "Numerous students are dissatisfied with this course, but perhaps we should direct our anger towards the TA, not the professor. The word &quot;harsh&quot; is not enough to describe the TA. I have never spent so much time on an assignment only to receive 10%. On the other hand, I find Torsten genuinely interested in the course material, smart, & helpful.",
      "Great Prof, start your labs early. Got EXTREMELY high mark from him",
      "Overall, Torsten is a great professor. Very laid back and easy to talk to. He seems really interested in what he's teaching. However, he's very easily distracted and somewhat disorganized during lectures. He always seems prepared to deliver an amazing lecture, but he gets so distracted by the class that sometimes he doesn't get to the good stuff.",
      "Torsten ROCKS!!!! He is incredibly laid back and you feel it in his lectures. They are enjoyable AND you leave learning a few things too!!! Super understanding and picks some GREAT material to read. I loved him sooo much Im taking 342 with him in the fall. He's awesome. You will think so too! Best English prof I've encountered at SFU!!!",
      "Such a great professor I've enrolled in his class 3 times...great class to take to gain credits with ease..he made my 4 course load feel like 3.",
      "One of the most easy-going, helpful, engaging profs I've ever had. He knows his stuff, and he actually cares that his students learn it, too. He is beyond reasonable, understanding, and witty. Anyone who says otherwise is just afraid to be out-classed. Attend just ONE day--just the first class, please, and judge for yourself.",
      "HE is by far the best prof i've had a st sfu. Not only does he give a simple quiz at the end of the term as his final, but he is extremly passionate about his work and is always evoking laughter. You are fortunate if you can get into one of his classes, he'll make your semmester",
      "Torsten is FANTASTIC. Lectures are painless, assignments are explained clearly, NO FINAL!, fun in class group play, nice guy and generally picks good material. Thumbs up! SFU better give him tenture before he gets a better offer.",
      "Just a really nice guy",
      "Excellent prof!!! Very nice, very funny (at least I think so), and shows that he is passionate about what he's teaching. Definitely recommend him, one of the best at SFU.",
      "Awesome. Makes learning this subject interesting and fun. This is the way teachers were meant to teach. His lectures are funny and he managed to make a boring topic really interesting... Best Proff to have... I would recommend all of his classes whether they are interesting or not...",
      "Torsten is an awesome prof! He's super nice, understanding of student's stressful schedules & very knowledgeable about course material. He loves teaching, esp. Shakespeare, and it shows. Definitely take a class with him if you can! Best Eng. prof I've taken at SFU. Another awesome one: Steve Collis. Good Luck!!",
      "Very nice guy, easy-going and empathetic towards student's needs. Funny sense of humour and really into his Shakespeare. Made the material understandable.",
      "Chaucer! well Torsten spends more time talking about &quot;things&quot; than actually learning Chaucer. No syllabus given out for what, when things are expected. Not someone who follows time-lines or structure. Nice guy tho'. But, the question remains to be seen: can he teach Chaucer&#63;",
      "No Comments",
      "Awesome teacher. Made Shakespeare fun! You're missing out if you don't take an English course with him. One of the best!",
      "Torsten's great. 'Nuff said.",
      "Torsten was a great prof, he is very intellignet and knows his Shakespeare. He made class interesting and you were never bored. Reading Shakespeare was made easier and alot more fun. Highly recommended that people take his classes. He never gave out too much work.",
      "He was a really funny prof and a good teacher, but id have to say i hate early shakespeare...talk about dull and boring! No offence Thorsten..you were a great prof!",
      "Torsten is an amazing prof! Great, engaging discussions, and open class plan - makes for a great teaching environment. his quirky attitude and chocolate addiction makes him a great person to hang around with and have class with. highly highly recommended! and he really knows his shakespeare stuff!!!",
      "Great prof.! Creates an open class environment condusive to intelluctual discourse; funny, friendly, knowledgable on subject matter; intrested in seeing students succeed. Recommended, wholeheartedly.",
      "Kind, funny, engaging prof. Class is self guided, especially since sometimes Torston seems scattered and unable to be critically analytical about material. Sometimes his lectures can come across as plot summary rather than helpful lit discussions. So unorganized that it hinders student's abilities",
      "Torsten is my favorite Engl prof. However, this is probably the worst class I've taken with him, and though it was still good, I prefer his Shakespeare courses, which everybody should take. Some advice: if you like structured courses with specific dates then Torsten is not the prof for you.",
      "torsten is the nicest guy ever. EVER. he's really engaging, i always listen in class and he's hilarious too. totally understanding with extensions and stuff. but don't take advantage of him, he's too good a person for that! :)",
      "Torsten is by far my favourite prof, in any faculty! Very nice, knowledgeable, un-intimidating, and funny to boot! If structure is your thing...what are you doing in the arts&#63; Keeps a light environment and understands the pressures of being an undergrad. Take as much as you can with him!",
      "Torsten is an awesome prof. Very understanding in assignments. Very approachable. A chocolate addict who loves his Shakespeare. If you can't decide which course to take, take his!",
      "Torsten is interesting, kind, honest, and genuine, and supportive. Absolutely loved his classes!",
      "I'm never intimidated in Torsten's classes. I was never one to participate that much in seminars but in his classes he puts you at ease and responds well to even dumb questions! Makes you feel like you know stuff and always motivates students.",
      "Awesome prof.",
      "Torsten is my favorite English prof. However, if you dislike profs that tend to go off on tangents he may not be for you.",
      "Torsten was a great prof. He really knows what he's talking about and his lectures are always interesting and funny. He makes reading Shakspeares plays really enjoyable, and helps students understand the deeper meaning in the plays.",
      "Torsten is the best english professor at sfu. He is incredibly intelligent and offers great insight into the text. He makes Shakespeare fun to learn and his lectures are always interesting. Very understanding and a very nice person.",
      "Torsten is a great prof. Sometimes goes off on very hilarious tangents. The most understanding prof I've had when it comes to assignments.",
      "Mixes philosophy with Shakespeare. A caring person who loves teaching. A very worthwhile professor. Highly recommended!",
      "Best prof in English Dept(not tenured yet to boot). Actually believes the theory should inform the text, a rare novelty at SFU's usually theory driven lackies. Take him for as much as you can. Can't believe someone thinks he's hot!!",
      "Great prof, great class. Very enjoyable. Very easy going in regards to assignments. Makes the class come alive.",
      "extraordinarily empathetic prof who is flexible with respect to assignments, deadlines, etc.; fun, enthusiastic, and well-read",

He says he could do the assignment in a few hours, well yes because he has so much experience, but for students 1-2 weeks is not even enough, so expectations can get quite high.",
      "Really good professor",
      "Amazing professor. Well guided and prepared lectures and you learn a lot. Only thing to watch out for is that this class (CMPT433) is one of the hardest courses I have ever taken in terms of workload. You will learn a lot but I also had no life outside of school lol",
      "Lots of fill-in-the-blanks. Can ask anonymous questions on Piazza. Definitely enthusiastic. Class average is high. Grade will be scaled down.",
      "Easy assignment/project and tough exam. You need to remember a lot of stuff to pass the exam. The curve is applied to this course. So pay more effort on the exam and you will be succeed.",
      "If all my courses were with Brian, I'd be the happiest person in the world. He really has a way of delivering the content in a very meaningful and engaging way. He is able to abstract ideas and make them relatable to everyone. Furthermore, he is SUPER helpful at all times, and even stays late for his students. )",
      "Ill say he is definitely the best prof in sfu. Extremely knowledgeable and willing to help. Assignments and project are very practical and useful in future. Take any course with him for real learning.",
      "The best prof I have ever had in my life",
      "He does his best to make material quite interesting during lectures. All the assignments are very practical as they are something you can actually use outside class. He is very accessible and cares a lot about his students. Be aware: heavy group projects, lectures are important as he tests something he only talks in lecture but are no in the notes.",
      "Good guy, gives videos to help with assignments that are pretty easy for what you should know at this level. Only complaint is he scales up how much you need for a decent grade by quite a bit so be confident that you can get at least 80% if you want something that won't break your GPA. Also check you can run android studio it is a memory hog.",
      "Brian's lectures are great and you get a lot out of his classes that can help you in future like co-op terms. Didn't had to prepare a lot extra for the exams, if you can do good in your assignments that it gets easier. If Brian is teaching any class, and you take from someone else, then it is a MISTAKE!",
      "I've taken around 5 courses with Brian, and all have been great experiences. He makes the content easy to understand plus assignments are very much related to the topic discussed in lectures. If you can do the assignments, then you will do good in exams.",
      "Pros: -group project is very useful (agile development method is used pretty much everywhere now) -lectures are crystal clear -kind and generous in general and very open to feedback from students Cons: -quizzes are VERY tricky",
      "Assignments are quite fair and his lectures are very informative",
      "nice",
      "Great guy. He knows his stuff well. Fun lecture. Assignment are fair and related to the materials in the course.",
      "He's keeping his enthusiasm and perfection just like 5 years ago when he started teaching at SFU. His lectures are very informative and clear. Assignments are there to help you understand the material and help you prepare for your exams. If he teaches a difficult class you haven't taken, take that class with him.",
      "Mind blowing lectures, assignments are given crystal clear marking schemes, summaries are provided for easy studying for mid-terms and finals. Focus in class for an easy A.",
      "Great prof, took his other classes before as well and he taught them just as good. Challenging in the beginning but everything becomes crystal clear as you approach the final exam. Make sure you understand all his notes (not too many confusing topics) and you will get a good mark.",
      "Glad computer science department has this guy. He is great!",
      "Truly the best prof I've ever had. In my 4th year now, I still can't forget how awesome he was.",
      "Had him for 2 other classes prior to this. Course content is easy, but exams can be VERY tricky (he takes pride in tricky MC). He's still a good prof, and takes his job very seriously. I like the lecture format, but assignments were tedious and long, while exams were trickier than they needed to be for a 200 level course",
      "Fabulous professor with absolutely amazing teaching skills. Keeps everything interesting, and tries his best to help out his students. The exams and assignments were all fair game, yet, far from easy. You will learn A LOT by having him as your prof. Recommended VERY VERY much!",
      "This guy is great! Extremely good lecturer. The textbook isn't required if you attend the class and take his \"fill-in-the-blank\" notes. And if you don't want to do that, ask a friend before the exams, and they'll most likely send them to you (try making one friend atleast!). The exams for this class, in particular, were all based around his notes.",
      "Good instructor. Put in the effort and you'll learn a lot. His assignments are not trivial; exams were fair.",
      "Great professor, extremely clear and concise. Be warned, assignments are incredibly time consuming, quite a few group assignments. Exams fair but you need to study study study. No offbeat questions -if you studied you were fine. Extremely helpful in office hours/email if you need assignment help.",
      "Awesome proff, probably the best you may ever have. He made a difficult and tedious course rather enjoyable and got students engaged in computer programming. The midterm was fair and so was his exam. The exam was leaning on the more difficult end though. Take a course with him a didn't regret it one bit. His awesomeness guarantees good grades.",
      "Excellent Prof, Super helpful, patient, Super nice, Very approachable",
      "Great professor. Very helpful and clear. Some assignments can be long, but you can always go for extra help. Midterm was fair.",
      "Great professor. One of the best at SFU. Always open to helping students after class and during office hours. Has helped me a lot with C programming.",
      "He's definitely very interested in the material and knows his stuff. Overall the course was a little unfocused but still a lot of useful stuff here.",
      "He is the best cmpt prof.",
      "He's simply awesome! He discusses everything thoroughly, highly entertaining, and he likes to keep his students engaged. His exams could be a little tough, but it's reasonable.",
      "Awesome professor! Takes the time to review the previous lecture and explains all slides in thorough detail. His lectures are always informative and entertaining, makes having an early class worth it :P",
      "One of the best prof. I actually look forward to his classes.",
      "Easy!",

EX. for 3 marks, what is an Operating System&#63; great guy. I got an A-. I spent a lot of time on his projects, but i actually learned about operating systems. Go for it!",
      "I failed the midterm but managed to get an A on this course. Take it with him if you are really there to learn.",
      "If you are taking courses to learn, this is 'THE' course to take!!! He has very interesting assignments and I would recommend him to anyone that asks. If you are in it for easy marks I would seriously not consider taking this course with him.",
      "Great prof. Relatively easy on material, lots of material though. Great for linux people. Generally a nice person.",
      "Managed to turn a dry subject into an interesting class. Highly recommended. He makes the nicest slides of any prof I've ever seen.",
      "Vaughanator didn't turn out to be that bad of a prof afterall. His assignments were generally long but do-able, and his final was fair. He also took time to help students in the lab, possibly because the TA's for the class seemed to be inexistant :/ . Overall decent prof.",
      "Richard rocked. He actually managed to make Operating Systems interesting, which was great. The assignments were fun, the lecturees (when he had them) were useful. Take 300 with the guy, way better than someone like Bart or RandomAsianProf2092.",
      "Very clear and entertaining prof; lectures were enjoyable and informative. A bit too laid back at times, and pretty slow in marking stuff. First time teaching, he'll get even better.",
      "No Comments",
      "lol...he rocks ... LOL",
      "Actually has some spirit and cares what his students think. A rookie prof but shows good promise!"

If I could, I would have taken this course 10 times more. Greg is the best prof I have ever seen in my entire life. Very difficult course, at least for me. Requires 100%dedication.",
      "He is great! He knows what he is talking about and keeps you busy with the right materials.",
      "(CMPT 419/726, Fall 2015) Do not underestimate the prereqs; this is the hardest undergrad CMPT course at SFU. I recommend taking at least MATH 251 and 309, and STAT 285. Greg has a superhuman skill to explain machine learning in depth but also with clarity, a rare combination in post-secondary. He also responds to emails blazing fast.",
      "He is the best prof you could have ever",
      "A very good professor! He is good at this field and his teaching style is humorous and friendly. Grading is fair.",
      "Really well organized course for any individual who want to get involved in the world of machine learning and its application",
      "Machine Learning is a tough course. The heavy math prereq of an A in every UG math course is not just for show, so know what you're getting into beforehand. Greg takes a topic with tons of complexity and abstract high-dimensional concepts and explains them clearer than anyone else could without dumbing things down. You will learn amazing things.",
      "Greg's lectures are great, although the assignments are really tough.",
      "I do suggest you to take his course. He is really patient and nice. you will get everything you need to know about cmpt225 after taken his course.",
      "one of the best professor, just do all the assignments you will get good grade , and yeh the exams are bit hard ..",
      "Great prof. Take 225 with him even if you have to wait.",
      "Sooo easy",
      "Really good prof for 225, lectures were long but very clear. Easy to understand and very open to questions. Assignments were defs not easy but take 225 with him, if you need any help go to his office hours or email - you'll get a fast reply! Great comp sci prof, he really cares & wants students to do well.",
      "Two words, Great Prof!",
      "This is the best computing science professor I've ever had. For every new thing we learn, he gives examples; if someone has a question, he is always willing to answer. Also, his assignments are entertaining (but a bit hard). I would definitely recommend.",
      "The best prof I've ever had. Although I won't get a good grade, but Greg is the best.",
      "LOVED HIM. EXCELLENT PROFESSOR",
      "Excellent prof. I was very scared of programming because I did not understand the concepts so well. After taking the course with him, I feel more comfortable, still scare, but not as much. He is always there to help. I always asked questions during and after class; and office hours and he was always helpful, clear and patience. Got A+ and was top 4",
      "Really good prof!!! (hands down) He does a really good job at explaining the material and if you don't get something he will be happy to help you during the office hours. The assignments were a do-able but the third assignment with the red/black trees was a pain. 1 midterm (Very EAsy) and 1 final (HARD). Good Luck!!!",
      "Amazing professor! This course is *not* for you unless you really want to learn. And if you do, you'll find it amazing. Mori covers tons of material, but in an extremely clear and understandable manner. He's really smart, and also really modest, so he's very approachable. Exam was very fair, and the assignments really reinforce the material.",
      "First of all, this is not an easy class in anyway, but this site is about the professor. Greg Mori is one of the best professors I have ever had in SFU. He makes sure that all the students understand the material, he is super friendly and I would take any class with him again, even though I did poorly in this class.",
      "Excellent Professor! He cares students so much that although some materials in lecture might be hard, he will explain and show examples more than once until he made sure that everyone can understand. You will find the course under his teaching become interesting. Some assignments takes time, but both TA and he will give detailed instruction!",
      "Great prof. Knowledgeable, good lectures, interesting assignments, available for help. I recommend taking 310 with him.",
      "young & engergetic prof, always try to make lectures fun tho the material is so dull; allows cheat sheets; long assignments (could be done in groups); he made AI even more awesome; robot soccer!! don't get frustrated by huge pile of readings; just follow his notes",
      "Very good prof. Excellent teaching ability. Very clear, funny, and down to earth about a complex theoretical subject. His assignments are not the easiest but he was overall fair I think.",
      "Awesome prof. However, he's a little dismissive of genetic algorithms. ;P",
      "great prof. will take his course again at any cost.",
      "great prof",
      "Fair assignments and tests. Very sympathetic of students, it's like he still remembers what it's like to be one :O Also, very sexy.",
      "He is very easy to follow, awesome lectures but... he rushes through the course quite a bit.",
      "Best computing science prof at SFU. If you have the chance to take this course with him, do it.",
      "Great prof. in teaching and relation with students.",
      "Excellent Prof. Lectures are informative and interesting. You learn excellent techniques that are practical in real life. Very helpful. One of the best profs I've ever had! If he is teaching, take that course!",

      "Great Prof. Had him a year ago, don't know if he still teaches here. Notes crystal clear, simple and goes over things in lecture very well. Assignments easy but projects may need a little bit of effort. Marks & tests very fairly",
      "Funny prof. But you need to know python well and prepare to code and debug. Best prof to be recommanded for CS students. May not be good if you don't know python.",
      "Great prof! His work load is a bit much but nothing too bad. Definitely doable and worth doing since the concepts find their way in the quizzes and definitely the final exam. He's more than reasonable and always willing to help! His notes are amazing and he programs during lectures so the lectures are definitely worth attending! Overall, amazing!!!",
      "Simply amazing! This guy is as close to the text-book definition of \"perfect\" as far as professors go. Passionate, helpful, reasonable and his notes are gold. I didn't have prior programming experience, but I still received an A+ in his class! Just study his notes, attend the lectures, ask for help, do his assignments, and you'll be fine. =]",
      "AWESOME PROF! very clear. lecture notes are really useful. Reasonable tests.",
      "Really cool, funny guy. This class was easy for me, since I had experience with the content already, but he's a great instructor.",
      "this guy is amazing,he is nice and super helpful just go to his office hrs and you will be fine. his project is ok.. if you dont know how to do the things you can go through the ppt that he sent out.",
      "I like him!!! He is a good teacher! But you need to work a little hard on his course.. He does give hard project, but he is a reasonable guy. The notes are there and he is helpful. If you try you will have fun time with him~ Do attend to his class, cuz he's class is funny.",
      "AWESOME PROF! Young, energetic and helpful. Clear and complete notes. Too bad, he'll leave, just after two weeks. I don't know how well he knows about computing science but he definitely knows how to teach a first year CS class which most of the other profs at SFU don't.",
      "Amazing Prof. I'm a student that skips a lot of classes, but I will go to this guy's EVERY class. His notes are 9/10 but his lectures are 10/10 (EVERYTHING is clear after the lecture!). Now onto the bad parts, his labs are extremely LONG, but not difficult, but at the same time FUN. Crazy right&#63; I didn't believe it myself.",
      "One of my favour profs in SFU!!!An awesome, funny guy. Course content is really useful. Just try to do all the labs and pay attention to his notes, you will be find. Have fun with his quiz bonus quesions!!lol~",
      "I took this course over a year ago and still talk about Colin. Such a young, funny lecturer, but 95% of the class was international so I suspect no one got his sense of humour. Hard class if you've never programmed before but Colin is always available for help. Super funny/easy bonus questions",
      "Awesome Prof! Colin programs during his lecture, which is terrific. Go to class, do the labs and you will ACE this course. It boosted my GPA :)",
      "The final exam was pass or fail for the whole couse no matter if you did well before. You are expect to work super hard in his class. forget about having fun if you don't already enjoy programming.",
      "Overall, I would say hes a good teacher. He posts lecture notes and goes through them in class and does examples. Lab work relates to his lecture notes, 2 projects, 1 MT, 4 quizzes and 50% final. Material isn't super hard but is workable. I found his class okay enough though I have no prior programing knowledge.",
      "I took this course as a GPA booster and indeed my GPA went up (I had previous experience with xhtml/css). His final exam however was a KILLER (for most students). The final question required full understanding of python: we were required to build an online shopping cart. The material was covered... but the last question was too damn long!",
      "Nice teacher~ and easy mark~ but you need to really understand your exercises and do your exercises and projects~! Final was not hard as projects~ and He curves the final,so you can get better grade!",
      "His assignment requires lots of work but definitely doable, and he's always available for help. For those complaining about the length of his projects, take a class with Diana. If you wanna actually learn stuff and willing to put effort into this course, take it with him. And he scales everyone up at the end, so not that hard to ace it at all.",
      "Tok this course distance ed! Wouldn't suggest you do if you cant handle elarning by yourself and guess/check type methods. Programming requires a lot of testing and re-testing. The webct forums were littered with &quot;im lsot, help&quot;, &quot;i have no clue what to do&quot;. And I guess thats why when I got a 77 it turned out to be an A.",
      "If you're thinking of taking this course as GPA booster then think again. You will regret taking this course with this prof. His last two projects are extremely difficult and the text book was pretty useless. I'm warning you avoid taking this course with this prof.",
      "I took CMPT 120 with this prof.(he said he didn't like to call himself as 'prof'). Anyway, his note is very clear and easy to understand, but lab and projects are needed time to finish. midterm and quizzes are getting to difficult and then final exam is extremely hard. Be aware that 1/3 ppl will be fail!",
      "He's a cool guy. Extremely helpful, especially outside of lecture. But, the course load is way too much for a level 100 course and his assignment difficulty is way too hard for the scope of this course. He stacks up projects and assignments so be wary if you;re going to have him. He also goes over class time.",
      "Overall a very amusing lecturer. He brings a new sense of energy to the class and still focuses on his lectures.",
      "Great prof. If you keep up with the material and and start your assignments early, you will do well. Colin is a very clear, entertaining, and funny lecturer.",
      "I WOULD ADVISE YOU NOT TO TAKE THIS PROF IF YOU ARE TRYING TO BRING YOUR GPA UP BECAUSE HE WILL DEFINETELY CRASH IT.....DONT TAKE HIM",
      "HE IS A VERY INTERESTING GUY AND KNOWS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT ALTHOUGH HE READS THROUGH HIS NOTES. HIS NOTES ARE VERY CLEAR BUT DONT BE DECIEVED .....WHEN THE GUY SAYS HE IS GOING TO FAIL ONE THIRD OF THE CLASS HE WILL FAIL IT. SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TAKE ANOTHER PROFF BUT HAVE HIS NOTES. HIS MARKING IS ALLOVER THE PLACE. DONT TAKE THIS PROFF.",
      "Great prof. For me, he really opened wide the world of computing science. Marking was fair and transparent. He encouraged questions and had a genuine interest in promoting understanding of the content. Outside of class, he was always available during his office hours and provided all the tools and explanations necessary to complete any assignment.",
      "One of the best profs ever. funny and uses a lot of cultural refrences (telling us to not bit torrent to download the VB program cus SFU has a download archive area). swears in his lectures. Course was A LOT better than the surrey version of CMPT 110. quizzes are open book, open notes. MT and Final, you're allowed to bring 4 page cheatsheet!"

      "This course combined actually a lot of learning without a huge onerous work load. We demoed are projects to the TA which gave immediate feedback. Dr. Funt was struggled having to teach some reasonably dense mathematics to class with a pretty diverse mathematical background but seemed to be able to convey the essential ideas successfully.",
      "Wow, best professor ever met. His lecture is very interesting. The material is challenging in a good way. Assignments are very helpful. One classmate got a well paid job by talking about one of the assignments we did in this course. Prof Funt is very patient to students and their questions. Very supportive for extra helps.",
      "Brian is a great prof for CMPT 102: he has good knowledge in Matlab and he is passionate in teaching it . I would say attending lectures is quite important for this course, as there are \"to-tries' for every lecture. It's a great opportunity since you code with ppl there to answer questions. It's an easy A if you do the practice in class.",
      "Great professor. Brian explains the points very clear and the homework was very interesting, although time consuming.",
      "Nice guy with a very hands-on teaching style. My main complaint is that he offers no practice questions even though most of the course is heavy on math, so the only way to study for exams is to understand the abstract concepts and then hope you can solve calculation problems during the exam. If he gave written problems he would be awesome.",
      "Great Professor ! Very kind and helpful.",
      "An approachable educator who definitely knows what he's teaching. His lecture slides are useful, though basic. So, you need to master the in class examples to complete the homework. Though he is decent at explaining things, I found the TA even more helpful than him. My only suggestion for Dr. Funt is that he boil down to simpler terms when teaching",
      "No textbook so you need to go to class. Always available for help and you can always ask questions in class. Allows cheat sheet for exams. Only need short to medium length answers for exams, but you have to think. Course is easier if you have MATH 251, 314 but still okay without it.",
      "difficult but fair exam questions, easy marking, a very interesting prof, sometimes unclear.",
      "nice prof, very helpful. It's better to learn from him than other computer vision books.Assignments are useful and pratical, exams are relatively hard.",
      "great prof. hard exam.",
      "Dr Funt is a great prof, he spearheaded getting this course switched to Matlab which is way more useful for most people who have to take it. He clearly wants the best for his students, and is very helpful. Assignments can be a little tricky, but they're interesting and instructive. All the tests were very fair.",
      "funt is a great prof. Just make sure you dont play on the computers during lecture! he does not like that. just listen and you'll be fine.",
      "I love professor Funt. This class would be a lot harder if it wasn't taught in CSIL. Matlab was a way better language to learn than Java or C++. I thought I would hate it, but this class is awesome.",
      "Dr. Funt is a very helpful,funny, caring teacher. He even me offered extra help outside the course content. One of the best professors I've had. A+ hands down. Very clear and reasonable in all testing and teaching aspects.",
      "One of the best profs out there. He tries his best to help you learn what the course is about. There was some difficult math in this course but he worked hard at making sure you understood it. If you need help he has no problem helping you and is very encouraging.",
      "Great prof, he explains every concept in detail and uses analogies to help with understanding. Puts very good effort into extra help for students that have questions.",
      "Complex concepts, but the difficulty of tests was balanced. You need to understand all those concepts (hard) but once you did, you'll get reasonably good mark on tests (easy) 'cause the questions themsselves are simple (frankly I expected more chalenges and studied accordingly so maybe I feld it was easy...)",
      "Astonishing professor. He can explain the most complicated things so well and makes the subject so sweet and useful. Although he is very mathematical in class, his tests do not require much math. He just wants to to &quot;understand&quot; the concept. Gives suprisingly high marks! 100% recommended!",

      "He is the best cs prof at UBC I had ever met. His lecture ppt and notes are clear and pretty helpful. He makes a very hard course easier. I definitely recommend you to take his classes. Really nice guy.",
      "His lectures are really good and he is very organized. He's also decently funny and very friendly. There really aren't any cons to him. two thumbs up",
      "Geoff is amazing. His lecture slides are perfect and super helping. He makes every concept very clear and straightforward. He is by far the best instructor in Comp Sci department.",
      "Honestly, you probably won't get a better professor than Geoff for 259. He is VERY organized and is also a nice guy in terms of marking/scaling/accessibility. Pretty funny too! The midterms can be a bit vague/difficult, but the material itself is not that hard.",
      "Geoff is an amazing instructor. Although his midterms and exams can be slightly vague and a bit hard at times, he puts his very best in explaining concepts in lectures (do go for his lectures). He is pretty generous with his office hours (do go for his hours, it's pretty empty) and is very patient in making sure you understand thoroughly.",
      "One of the better profs I've had in my time at UBC. Lectures are very clear, very engaging with humor that's actually funny and not a desperate call for engagement. Prepares you really well for the exams.",
      "Superb instructor! Very clear lectures with great examples and explanations. He definitely knows his stuff and can answer any questions that come up. CPSC221 as a course is fairly heavy in material by nature so I don't blame Geoff for the difficulty. Lectures are often very funny as well!",
      "Geoff was really great! I personally thought he was one of the best lecturers I've had at UBC. He's very clear and concise with concepts and what you need to know for the course, and he patiently answers any questions that arise in class. In office hours, he'll be very determined to help you solve any problems you have!",
      "Geoff's no doubt a great prof, and though some of my peers think he's a little monotoned, I find his lectures to be very clear and I love how he explains the difficult concepts to you as if you were an 8 year old. Super easy to follow, super easy to understand. He's accessible during his office hours, answers questions very patiently.",
      "His lectures are very clear and concise, and he is always willing to answer questions. So the lectures become quite easy to follow. He is nice and helpful in his office hours(4 hrs per week). Take 221 with Geoff!!!!",
      "One of the best computer science profs ever. I wish he would go over more binary search tree's though.",
      "I love him.",
      "All around solid professor. Does a great job in lecture of explaining concepts thoroughly. Grading criteria is very detailed and fair. Would take his course again.",
      "The only thing I can say is that if you're having trouble, go to his office hours. He can be a little disorganized during lecture but I guarantee you'll be able to clear things up if you talk to him in private. Yes, his exams are hard but they get scaled.",
      "Even when dealing with family problems during the semester, Geoffrey still finds a way to cater to students before exams and assignment due dates with extra office hours. He's the type of professor that is more than willing to explain things again during office hours if you're stuck on an assignment or don't understand a concept. Huge respect!",
      "Geoff is a good professor. Had him as a sessional lecturer at UBC for our intro algorithms course. The midterm was easy but the final was hilariously difficult - I'm not sure if half the class passed before scaling. Just know how to apply the material - you can expect many coding questions on his exams.",
      "Assignments and exams are tough but he is there for you .If in doubt, ask him questions via E-mail, attend office hours. Stays well over his office hours if students need help. He is the kind of professor we need in our department.",
      "Geoff delivers good lectures and is helpful in his office hours. His assignments are above average difficulty (compared to John Edgar's which are viewable online). His exams are quite difficult and he gives you no way to prepare for them. Overall, he teaches well with kind of hard assignments, but asks unreasonably difficult questions on the exam.",
      "Good teaching skill but the final is hard for this semester. One of my friend said it was easy last year.",
      "Geoff is a very clear lecturer. He also gives good help in his office hours. He is a difficult professor though (tough tests and assignments). He'll teach you well, but he'll expect a lot out of you.",
      "Geoff is a very good professor. He's clear in lecture and in his expectations for what you should know. He's pretty quick to help you via E-mail too. His exams and assignments are neither super difficult not easy, they were pretty reasonable in my opinion.",
      "He is a really nice person. USE HIE OFFICE HOUR, it will help you a lot. Do the assignment ASAP and ask any question you don't know. midterm and final are ok. Do all the lecture note's questions, that is the key to pass this class.",
      "Helpful when asked. Assignment criteria is clear. Little feedback for marks. Rarely open to understanding an answer from another point of view. Lectures are often dull.",
      "Very amicable and helpful in one-on-one interactions, especially during office hours. However, lectures can get somewhat monotonous, which might just be a reflection of the course material. Make sure to clarify questions during exams because some of them can be worded ambiguously.",
      "He has been really helpful during office hour and explained materials well. Also the marking criteria are well justified. The only thing that might catch you off guard is the amount of effort each assignment requires. Try to do them ASAP and ask for help if you are stuck somewhere. Midterm and final are alright with a few tricky questions.",
      "GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS! Probably one of the nicest and passionate guys I've met so far in the field (I saw him stay for hours beyond his scheduled hours if students needed the help). My only issue with him is the range in difficulty of the assignments. They are either very easy or painfully hard. Start the assignments ASAP so you can ask for help.",
      "Pay close attention in lecture and you'll save yourself time later on the assignments and on the exams. Do the problems he provides in class. Geoffrey is very helpful during office hours and after lecture. While the grading scheme is not easy, he is very fair and will go over your assignments with you to show what you need to work on."

      "Excellent Class and Excellent Prof",
      "He is the best prof that fits in what I believe to be the best way to learn and be tested. He gives clear lectures which his exams are all based on them and the homework. Even he was old school using paper and pen in class, but he is the only one prof that I have taken who uses the recording system for us to review his lectures online. Take him!!!",
      "CMPT 307 is hard, but he makes it as simple as possible. I am surprised that his explanations for Master Formula and SELECT are way better than the ones in the textbook. The weekly assignments roughly took 15 hours each, but they are the core for getting good marks on exams. Memorizing solutions usually doesn't work, but understanding logic does.",
      "Very knowledgeable and smart prof, so it's worth to attend and listen to him. The biggest problem of this prof is you won't be able to get complete answers for your assignments. He shows solutions for SOME questions but not all. So, you don't know if your answers are correct for the other questions (TA marks the questions the prof showed answers).",
      "I took Combinatorics/Graph Theory from Prof. Hell 40 years ago, and it was (really!) life-changing. What I learned, esp. from programming assignments, made things easy in my 1st job as a database professional. More important, I learned teaching techniques I use all the time, and I ran business process imprvmt workshops on five continents last year.",
      "Great proof. Killer final but very nice curve. As long as you attend all the lecture and take notes, you should be okay. most of exam questions are from the lecture notes and homework. overall great prof.",
      "Hard course in general, and he's well-experienced teaching it. However I wish there'd been more feedbacks for students during the semester. Seeing my grades for assignments and midterm, it was not clear to me if I'd pass the course, which embarrassed me the whole time. But at the end I'm happy with my grade.",
      "very hard course, one of the hardest among CMPT courses.his teaching skill is above average.The assignments are very time consuming (one assignment per week).exams seem intimidating, but actually fair after u take a closer look",
      "Very good prof, The course is taught like a math course, weekly assignments and such (some of which are hard) but thats how you learn the material. He is also crystal clear in his lectures and very approachable for help during office hours.",
      "Very good professor, but difficult course content. He explained everything very well. The homework was not to long but it was difficult. His midterm and final exam seemed intimidating at first but they were manageable.",
      "Good teacher, hard topic, he did well to help most of the students pass and his class always has more people passing, so i guess that means he's easier or a better teacher than other people for this class",
      "Knows the course material very well, and teaches the stuff better than anyone at SFU.",
      "Take him should you be hardworking.",
      "He's a famous prof and a good teacher. Although he's moody and his presentation is a bit boring. There must be a problem with his ears or his english because he didn't get some of the questions during the lectures. Very hard homework questions but he solves them right after the deadline. Too much strict for homework deadline which is the very begin",
      "3 hours lecture. dry but understandable... Requires alot of thinking and creativity. It always seems like hes jumping around topics and hard to follow if you are working through the textbook. Midterm consists of 50%+ homework questions... good for some, bad for others that don't like memorizing...",
      "Great prof, the course is hard if you've never seen any of this stuff before but he does a good job with explaining it.",
      "He's an awesome prof. Heaven is a good word to describe him. In what was always talked as the hardest CS class, he made it seem pretty understandable with simple concepts, etc. Everyone did well in his class. So take him!",
      "A very good prof. Course is not bad, if you spent time do/understand all the assignments. I think it's good that he made the noisy people be quite.",
      "lectures with clarity! easy to understand, great prof",
      "He is not &quot;HELL&quot; at all!!!",
      "Good prof good lectures",
      "He is the best MACM prof ever!! The stuff is hard, be he teaches it well",

      "his exams are hard, but the questions are fair. do practice from his homework to make sure you can speed through the easy questions, and write very detailly in your answers. lectures are a bit dull since he mostly just read his note, so do ask him if you didn't get something. the biggest flaw of his course is a quiz on the last day of class.",
      "Kabanets covers the content well. He defines all terms that are used. The quizzes are challenging, but doable (and curved). The final has an easy bonus question (what is your favourite algorithm) that is worth something meaningful (5 bonus points out of 100 points on exam).",
      "4 quizzes. Requires some critical thinking. Pauses lecture regularly and asks if we have any questions. Nice during office hours. Only thing I don't like is his voice makes me sleepy. Definitely recommended for CMPT 307.",
      "super nice and caring . A real gem:)",
      "We had 4 quizzes and 1 final exam. Quizzes were based on assignments which were quite challenging. Be prepared to memorize algorithms, time complexity and proof by induction so forth. You need to put decent amount of time to understand materials. Valentine teaches it well, really cares about students' learning. Overall, I recommend him",
      "lectures are somewhat interesting and you can tell Valentine is passionate about algorithms and time complexity. Quizzes and exams are challenging",
      "My biggest beef with him is the exams. Some of the exam questions are downright unfair, and they look nothing like the material presented during class. He likes to take some questions from obscure theoretical computing science results that only a researcher would typically be well-versed about in a THIRD YEAR COURSE.",
      "Some of my classmates complained the assignments and midterms are brutal hard. I found them okay given that you do need to put a lot of thoughts and effort into it. Need some mathematics skills I suppose. Clear lecture, useful notes and examples.",
      "Incredibly knowledgeable and articulate. His lectures were organized and had a good flow, leaving no gaps in understanding. They were supportive for approaching new problems in the assignments. And the assignments were designed to solidify the lecture material. An excellent teacher.",
      "Good prof and hard course. Notes posted online doesn't help much. Careful when you want to get this course.",
      "Great prof, very nice, open to feedback and suggestions. Interesting and interactive lectures. Exams aren't a slam dunk, but are mostly applying the same techniques from lectures and assignments to different flavored problems. Grades curved reasonably. Notes posted online, you're missing out on the useful examples and diagrams if you skip though.",
      "Valentine is one of the best Prof in SFU. He knows his staff and knows how to teach. The assignment is well related to quiz, and he will give the solution before the quiz. He makes this course much easier.",
      "He tries to cover everything in the book, but you have to do all the real work. He does his job and does not care if everybody fails or everybody passes with A(Not Likely at all!). Nice guy.",
      "Very good professor! He was very clear and his pacing was good. Of all the profs I had this semester, he is the only one who marked final exams quickly and posted the marks early enough for us to ask questions. His marking was also very fair. If the TAs ever marked anything wrong, he would fix your grade. This makes all the difference in the world!",
      "Good professor, of course. Final is not hard with bonus points. Reviewing quiz and materials will help to figure out questions. Don't expect to get a good grade without hard work.",
      "Extremely tough subject to teach as a lot of the concepts are very tough. Almost all algorithms and little about data structures. He tries very hard to make sure you understand and encourages us to ask for help. I find the grading scheme a little tough 4 15% quizzes and a 40% final. Should be some assignments to distribute the grade more.",
      "I didn't get a good grade in this course because I think the exams are hard, especially the last two quizes and the final exam. But the prof is a nice guy who can explain the concept and material well. His attitude is very nice and you can ask anything if you have questions.",
      "Covered a considerable amount of the Cormen book (for a first Algorithms course). Was very enthusiastic about the material and gave a deeper insight into complexity theory than what is normal for first Algo course. Assignments were challenging but interesting and were offset by more reasonable exams.",
      "I can certainly say that he is (one of) the most dedicated professor teacher(s) at SFU, even in whole Canada/world. He is amazingly organized and well-prepared for his classes; and also his profound knowledge rocks his classes.",
      "Great professor, really interested in the subject. He goes over a lot of stuff from MACM and CMPT 225, but there is a lot of stuff to learn as well. My only complaint is that I wish we went into hashing and red black trees. His TAs were very lenient on the marking, worried I wouldn't do so well in the course but pulled out with a B!",
      "Half the material you will have learnt from CMPT225 or other previous CS courses. The assignments are quite challenging,so you might not even be able to start,while the midterms and final are much more easier.You will have no problem if you do your assignments and understand all the assignment solutions. P.S He is also an easy marker.",
      "One of the best profs in SFU CS dep. He REALLY knows what he is teaching. He is so knowledgeable in algs and complexity. He teaches clearly. So attending classes is a must. Assignments are killers and so difficult but that's the way you learn the course content. Midterms and finals are SO FARE and based on assignments.",
      "An extremely hard subject taught clearly. Cares a lot for students. Answers questions thoroughly. Gives challenging homework but fair tests.",
      "I was scared of this course and the lectures I went to scared me even more, as I barely ever understood everything. His assignments were also fairly challenging, but you really learn a lot from the assignments. He is a really smart prof and both midterm and final were easy in my opinion. I got an A- in this class and the average was 65% (rel. high)",
      "I never was very good at math. However, his teaching is very good. You understand the core concepts quite well. Also, his assignments/exams and their marking are very fair, unlike many other math courses I've taken. As long as you put effort into the class, you will do OK. Everyone I've talked to likes him, and I'm not surprised.",

      "Professor Shinkar doesn't post solutions for practice questions and assignments. If you are not good at coding, avoid him. He covered a lot in CMPT125. The final exam was very difficult. Many questions ask for writing code in C. But you will learn a lot from his lecture and his lecture is interesting. He always replies emails and questions online.",
      "As a new instructor here, he is super nice to students.",
      "Extremely extremely patient. Willing to explain the same thing over and over again if you don't understand. I did not have any programming exp before except for 120, so I worked quite hard in order to get above average. Make sure you do all the practice questions he gives, and you'll be fine on the exams. He's also really cute.",
      "Encourages and answers questions during and after class. Very accessible and good at explaining the material. I highly recommend attending the lectures.",
      "I enjoyed Igor's lectures. I didn't show up to every one (especially the two hour lectures), but I did find his lectures helpful. I went in not knowing a thing about C and came out with a lot of confidence in algorithms, Big O, data structures and using C (helpful for CMPT127). My only criticism is that he sometimes goes a little too fast.",
      "Dr. Shinkar explained all concepts exceptionally well and gave many opportunities for participation although it was not required. Biweekly quizzes were fairly easy and the 5 assignments given over the semester never took too long. Great course overall.",
      "Super easy class and great teacher. You will learn a lot from his explanations and his practice code. He really cares about his students and he will give you all the help you need to succeed in his course. Just give a little effort and you will do great.",
      "Pretty average lectures and slides. Covered a lot of material. Answers lots of questions in Piazza. Midterm was good, final was significantly harder.",
      "Definitely one of the best prof I have had in SFU so far, expectation and grading were clear and concise. Although his lecture and slides may not be the best thing ever, his passion and knowledge on the topic can really change the dynamic of the class!! Also, easily accessible during office hours and on piazza which is a huge bonus.",
      "Nice prof, always answers questions. Lectures are a bit unorganized but slides are usually pretty clear. Grading was fair.",
      "He's trying to cover as much material as possible. Whenever I had questions, he was &quot;always&quot; easily accessible via forum called &quot;piaza&quot;. His lecture skill and quality of slide was mediocre, but considering that it was his first time teaching in SFU, I think it will be better.",
      "He is an exceptional professor and I am lucky to be enrolled in his classes. He is very accessible and one of the best teachers I have ever encountered. I wish I could enrol in more of his classes.",
      "Best professor for a cmpt course! Lectures are informational, though you will learn alot of things, professor Shinkar makes it very clear and fair on the exams. Overall, very fair and you will pass all exams if you understand the assignments.",
      "Awesome professor! His lectures are very enjoyable and he is willing to put in the time to make sure you understand the concepts.",
      "The final grade is released. I am surprised by my grade because Prof. Shinkar is so respective and considerate. Typically for science courses as long as you do not get 50% over final and midterm, you will fail the course. In this case 50 people will fail but Igor he only gave like 25. Also he gives more A's and the average goes to B-. He is nice.",
      "Great prof, always accessible via Piazza (even in the wee hours of the morning), and truly cares about his students, particularly during exam season. Had doubts about his teaching at the start of the semester, but he really did his best to ensure everyone's success... Also let's you know when &quot;pop&quot; quizzes will be.",
      "Prof. Shinkar is accessible through piazza at almost any time. He tried hard to improve his teaching. He is a very respectful person.",
      "Never really do this for profs but wanted to write this for Igor because he is honestly a great prof. He explains concepts very well(Course Slides done very well), has really interesting course material, and answers questions good. Attended every class because its worth it, and will definitely take future classes with him if he is teaching.",
      "This professor tries really hard and genuinely cares about his work and students. Definitely a rare sight in SFU.",
      "Professor codes on the fly and if it doesn't compile, he is able to quickly troubleshoot errors. Very clear on what you need to learn. Gives tons of exercises (not for marks). Assignments take a pretty long time to do and are due every 2 weeks. Midterms and Finals are fair but hard. A lot of written coding required.",
      "Dr. Shinkar is the greatest CS teacher I have ever had. To start off, I feel blessed to have a teacher who did his post-doctoral at UC Berkeley. He genuinely wants you to learn the topics and understand the big picture. Given that, he marks everything very reasonably and you can expect to do well if you put in the effort. Well done, Dr. Shinkar.",
      "Ok. The final is kind of hard. But I still love Prof Shinkar as he temporarily added half an hour more for our final, which was really nice and considerate. Great teacher.",
      "really love this profg!! explain everything clear. exams are not hard if you pay attention to the class. also you need to work hard on the practice question he give you. however, a very pleasant experience on taking this course with igor shinkar!",
      "Dr. Shinkar is the best professor I've had so far in CS. He explains things dynamically to make the concepts more clear. I appreciate how he pauses at the end of each section to ask if there are any questions, and actually took looks for hands instead of rushing to the next section. His marking is very fair and he accessible via Piazza",
      "Hands down the best professor to ever teach CMPT 125 at SFU. His midterms aren't exactly that hard if you pay attention in lecture. Lectures are interactive and the only one that has kept me awake so far for my duration at SFU. Hopefully he continues to teach at SFU so I can take a class with him again.",
      "I agree with all previous comments. Awesome prof! It seems like he covered more material than previous CMPT125 profs, which is good b/c it prepares you for CMPT225, but if you only took 120 before this, then you weren't prepared for 125 in the first place,... so you'll probably struggle. The learning curve has to get you at some point!",
      "Professor Shinkar is really nice. I hardly see an instructor who is so responsible and patient like him. He always responses your question quickly. I can feel that he really wants you to be great and interested in computing science. Wish to learn with him in future again.",
      "You will not regret taking this class with this professor. Fair amount of homework to get you prepared for exam so long as you take it seriously. Tests are fair and not like some teachers that expect a great amount from you. I definitely feel like I have learned a lot and am more confident in my coding knowledge.",
      "Dr. Shinkar is awesome. Friendly, passionate about the subject, encourages asking questions, etc. I found this course very challenging (other professors for 125 did not cover nearly as much/make 125 as difficult) but I'm glad I took it with Dr. Shinkar for this reason, as I feel like I've learned a lot over the semester.",
      "I love him and I'm sure many do as well. Enthusiastic, responsive, friendly. Dr. Shinkar is probably one of the most humble and caring professors in this school. Assignments/exams aren't too hard as long as you understand what the lectures are about and do coding practice. Super glad that I took this class. How's that for a nice thing to say? :D",
      "great prof. seay to understand",
      "Great prof, always willing to help you understand the concepts. Responds to emails very fast as wells as post on piazza. Fair marker when it came to assignments and exams. The class it self is kind of difficult due to it having a lot of different concepts but Igor only asked questions that are directly related to the material.",
      "great professor. Responds quickly to emails and to piazza. He helped me with the material many times. Igor really cares about the students, and wants everyone to succeed."

The midterm average was 20-30%, and I'm pretty sure more than half the class failed. Though I like Art, I advise you wait for a different prof unless you thought MACM 201 was an easy course.",
      "He teaches the material well, exams are fair. Unfortunately, he seemed to have an irrational hatred for our class. Midterms were arbitrarily remarked and marked down A LOT. He then flipped out on us and said he wouldn\u00e8t scale. Final was really easy, yet his marking, again... put the average way below 50%. More than half the class failed.",
      "Great at teaching a difficult subject. Any problems usually came from the complexity of the subject, no from him.

      "Very hard project, but thankfully, a fun project and the small assignment load made it easier. Jian is a very clear prof and an excellent teacher.",
      "Very nice in assigning the final grades. Tough and fair final exam. I did not spend enough time until the last 2 weeks. The email discussion with him was particularly helpful. If I could take it once more, I would spend more time and do much better.",
      "Touch midterm, but close enough to assignments. Overall challenging and interesting. One of the best in this school.",
      "Very good prof, fair and knows how to teach :)",
      "Very interesting project, though sounds challenging. He explained the major ideas clearly, and left the details for you. Clear lectures, easy to follow. Of course, you have to read the textbook after the class. He has accent, but not too bad. Highly recommended by people in his classes before. Very nice guy overall.",
      "Super easy. Class average is currently around 95%... what this means for final grades we'll see. Interesting project and decent lectures. He is clear and seems to understand what to say to convey the material clearly and efficiently.",

      "Dr. Kay is one of the best prof at SFU. He is very organised and his lecture is always helping you to understand the logic not memorising. If you regularly attend the lecture and follow his advice, at least B- is there. I hope all the course could be taught by him.",
      "Best Prof I ever had at SFU! Teaches very well and cares about student's learning and success. Would take again. 10/10",
      "Good professor, humurous, and understands students do not have the luxury to invest all their time into one Math course. Tells you what to expect on the exams. 10/10 would take again",
      "Awesome prof choice for MACM 101. As a first year, he introduced the concepts very well (however, it was very theory-heavy). It was an enjoyable class and he was always happy to help students whenever possible. The midterm / quiz were very easy, the final went into depth with specific concepts. Overall super enjoyable.",
      "Kay is awesome! He's very passionate about teaching and obviously knows what he's talking about. The course itself is quite difficult but he offers alot of examples and extra help when asked.",
      "Excluding content, very good at teaching and presenting. Sows down on difficult or important topics we need to grasp. Because MACM 101 is filled with facts, it restrains time that we don't get to comprehend the material clearly. But, friendly, and will give you tips for the exams. Exams are not hard. Recommended to study early. Cool accent, btw!",
      "The first midterm is worth 40% and is basically a freebie as he makes it easy. The lectures are slow before the first midterm. Then he goes very fast after it, with a final worth 50% and is way more difficult than the material you see in class.",
      "Great professor and can teach this course incredibly well. Be prepared to attend every lecture and take notes. The notes are incredibly helpful and will help you succeed in his class.",
      "He's a great prof, once he gets warmed up with the class he's more easy-going and it makes the lectures a little more fun. Attendance to lectures is mandatory if you want to pass because he handwrites his notes, therefore they cannot be downloaded off the internet. However, he is quite good at explaining and is there to help.",
      "As long as you do all the review, readings, and assignments to the point that you fully understand all the concepts, you're guaranteed an A in this class. Attending lecture is crucial, he covers a lot of material in class, especially after the first midterm. Very willing to help, and most importantly, teaches extremely well!",
      "People are way too nice. His midterms are not that easy and his final exams are way too hard. He teaches extra material that he didn't cover in class and tests you on it in the final exam.",
      "Easiest A+ I have get,best prof ever",
      "78% midterm, 59% final average. 11/92 people failed the course because they failed the final. (thats his rule)... best to study assigments",
      "One of the best professors for teaching MACM 101. Midterm was extremely easy. As long as you attend lecture and do the homework/review questions, you can easily get 80%+",
      "I highly recommend Dr. Wiese. Very clear, helpful and patient. Obvious he really knows his stuff. He makes the course easy for you; and only tests you on relevant material. (and the cheat sheet really takes the stress out of the exam)",
      "Very Good Prof. If you do not understand anything he will explain very well. If you do understand it can be quiet boring. Assignments and Midterms are very similar and he allows cheat sheets on finals and midterms. Highly recommended you take him for MACM.",
      "He was a great teacher. I did great for the midterm (A), then I slacked off after that. I only completed half of every assignment, which was a big mistake. JUST fully complete the assignments and study for the final (which was, whether I had continued to study hard or not throughout the course, harder than the midterm)and you will get ur A or B."

Asking him for help was always super easy because he usually responds on the Canvas discussion board. If anyone is interested in Cmpt 363 or needs extra credits. Paul's class is honestly the best choice.",
      "Paul is one of the best professors at SFU. He not only lectures, but also actively works in the industry. He has a highly modern teaching style & seems to genuinely care about his students. He is polite, professional & is always available. All readings are (free) online, group project is big but allows you to pick your own groups & grade your peers",
      "He is one of the best Professor at SFU. Recommend!",
      "He marked assignments and test subjectively. He likes out dated concept from textbook and disagrees creative designs. Even you spend a lot of time on doing \"REAL\" user research and design a \"REAL\" UI that SFU students really need. He will still give you low marks due to his personal point of view. Avoid this class if you do want to be creative.",

      "Every lecture with Hibbitts will blow your mind. The material is interesting, well organized, and teaches you valuable skills. If you can show you understand the material, even if you do bad on assignments or the midterm, you can still get an A in this course. Paul Hibbitts is a god amongst men! Do not miss your chance to take this course with him.",
      "A++ prof. Take Paul if you want to learn excellent user centered design. SIAT students should also take this course as you learn a lot more then in other IAT courses. Assignments and marking is beyond fair and you really get to use everything that you have learned in class for the three group assignments.",
      "Opposite to the common belief, I didn't find the marking to this course subjective. It's just a matter of learning certain concepts and applying them on practice. Very helpful prof and very interesting lectures.",
      "I enjoyed almost every class. He knows what he's talking about, and directly linked it to real world examples. The course yields an easier work-load, which is not Paul's fault. He did a great job teaching the material. I have heard he can be non-helpful to some people though. Can't win em all.",
      "Shows great understanding of the material (especially thru his lectures). Assignments are very well-related and requires the student to do a little more than usual. Midterm and final exam are subjective and requires you to really know your stuff. Overall, a great course and a great prof. (BEST ONE!)",

      "I took this class ages ago! I was just looking at some of my SFU prof's pages on RMP. As most of people mentioned here, the prof was very nice. Fair amount of assignments and I remember exams were similar to the problems in the assignments.",

      "She can't teach but the assignments and labs are pretty easy. Stutters a lot during lectures and because of it, less than 50 out of 120 students bother attending her lectures. Only reason to attend is for possible quizzes for bonus marks otherwise you're better off just reading the lecture notes she provides, at home.",
      "If you just read the notes, and understand them (not a difficult task, if you're not stupid) and attend her lectures for possible quizes you can easily get an A.",
      "Good overall. Good for your GPA if you know DS. There are bonus marks if you attend the class (bonus quizzes) which make it easy to get an A.",
      "I got an A- by attending the class less than 10 times (as it was boring). Ppt notes were quite well (not done by her). She basically just reads off the powerpoint for the entire lecture. Her assignments were fair. She's quite helpful. Recommend for students who have good cs basics and don't mind doing some independent studying."

Also answers any question in class, so just ask. The TA we had was a super easy marker. The actual subject is definitely not straight forward tho. But if you have Ke, you already half passed",

      "HE IS THE BEST. I took CMPT130/135 with him last year and because of him I have very strong foundations in C++. There is no prof who can teach C++ better than him. You just need to understand his slides and you can do all assignments, midterms and final without touching the book. His programming assignments really help in understanding too.",

In 383 you get really into functional programming and the languages you have to learn really teaches you to think in a different way. Very fair assignments and exams. Take this course with him.",
      "His lectures were interesting, and his assignments were well related to the material that he taught. His midterm and final were fair, completely based on the notes for his class. Didn't use the textbook much, just read his notes on his website. If you had to take this class, take it with him!",
      "Excellent Prof. His online notes are awesome! Just study those thoroughly. His assignments are super fun. They are like puzzles and are about the right difficulty. Highly recommend this prof for CMPT 383!!",
      "Great & helpful prof! Very glad to have taken 383 with him, he couldn't have explained concepts better. His midterm/final were extremely fair, if you studied you did fine - generally he will give outlines, follow them! Assignments/projects sometimes tedious but for the most part very manageable. Great course overall! Definitely recommend.",
      "The best CMPT166 teacher ever!!!",
      "The best pro I have ever seen in my life!!! High recommended!!!!",
      "Great prof, doesn't teach with slides but rather through example-I find this better for programming courses as you can follow along easier. Despite what was previously said, my friends and I found him to be quite funny. Final wasn't too bad, practice the problem sets given!",
      "Really takes the time to explain things in detail. And, instead of simply reading slides off a powerpoint, he actually engages himself into doing some examples in class.",
      "Odd personality, very intelligent concerning his subject. Tends to have low expectations of students concerning their abilities to provide quality work.",
      "No Comments",
      "Great prof! Very helpful and he doesn't make you feel stupid when you ask him a question. Midterm was veryy fair and easy, it was so much easier than i thought it was going to be. Final was very fair if you studied and know your stuff."

      "If you would like to actually learn, and be in a good class then take this course with her!",
      "Great professor. You follow the slides, and listen in class you should be have a decent mark. If you ever have questions or problems, she is very kind and will help you out. She understands the situations students are in, and keeps that in mind when it comes to assignments or exams. I highly recommend her, unless you want to do programming!",
      "Her assignments and exam are fair, but her attitudes during class are excellent. her teaching is clear. she ll teach u more if u ask her during her office hour. she makes me feel the course is interesting and fun. ofcourse, u still have to work hard and think hard to get a high mark",
      "Best professor ever! She is inspiring when she teaches her subject. She is a very nice person, who cares about her students. She's also a fair marker. I only wish she also taught Networking II. As it is, the choices for that course are not great.",
      "Very good professor. Extremely clear lectures.",
      "Funda is bar none the best professor I've had so far at SFU. Fun, helpful, and very engaging -- she genuinely cares about her students. There's no wonder why she's the graduate director!",
      "I enjoyed Funda's class, she's got a great sense of humour. Assignments and tests are both fair, imo (plus the class is always curved). Teaches from textbook-based slides that are posted online. My only gripes are that she can be a tad disorganized and her wording on assignments can be vague at times.",
      "A prof whose exams seem extremely hard, but at the end of the day, she marks very fair and really tests if you know what you're doing or not. I didn't much like the popup quizes, aka attendance checks, but i guess that's her choice. Assignments were doable and marked easily.",
      "An excellent teacher to take 371 with. I have no idea why people complain about her using the powerpoint slides that come with the textbook, they're good slides! I much happier that she used them then tried making up her own material. Her explanations aren't always clear but if you ask her to work through an example you'll get what she means.",
      "she is not quite up-to-date, but knows the course content well enough to teach it. you can do just as well by reading the textbook alone, although her explanations help, but they're just so long and windy...",
      "Very nice and knowledable prof. Will take the time (sometimes too long) to explain the finer details, and always (and I do mean always) checks to see if there are questions. Only major complaint is that 99% of the class was her reading power point notes (which she said at the beginning of the term she wouldn't do). Otherwise, very good prof.",

You've got to study off of the notes, and you'll do fine. Got an A+ and I attended half the lectures. Just study the slides and notes, and you'll be fine.",

Exams are pretty easy, read through her lecture notes and you'll easily get a decent grade. Would definitely take another course with her if I got the opportunity.",

      "Course involves a semester-long group project, so beware of deadweight group members. Slept through 90% of lectures and still managed to get an A. Assignments are generally fair (though difficulty may depend on what your group decides to for the project), exams are also very fair. Grades participation based on class activity handout sheets.",

      "I had an enjoyable time with her for summer 2007 intersession, but too bad it wasn't full semester. Tries to keep lecs interesting, and admits she's like all of us who aren't experts in all user interfaces. That's how we learn and improve. Manageable tests and asns and fairly marked. More importantly they reflect what we learned in class and text.",
      "Very easy course and she's a good prof, minus her inability to use exactly what she's teaching (i.e. interfaces) Some things are annoying about her but marking is fair and class expectations are more than fair - at least for this course which was a breeze. The notes are decent, and lectures aren't all that boring.",

      "First time teaching this course. Basically summarizes the recommended text and present them to us. Good research background, but comments regarding HCI made in class are too subjective. This is a theory class; not an art class. A lot of overlap with CMPT 275. A lot of work required; be prepared.",

      "The professor is very nice and informative, even though i have no background of coding and never went to the lab to ask for help. I could still learnt alot from Dr Lim, just by attend the lecture(it is extremely helpful). The exams are not too hard, but some of them maybe tricky. However, if you pay enough effort, it will be a gpa booster.",

TERRIFIED FOR FINAL BC NO CHEAT SHEET.",

      "She's a decent 1st time prof with good explanations. She posts everything and records lectures so that's no need to attend but you should. Homework was free marks but her exams had hard MCQ and she didn't allow a cheatsheet in the final so memorize your syntax! My other complaint was she only had 1 office hour per week but she helped after class.",
      "She encourages everyone to bring their laptops to code along with her during lectures, so you actually leave each lecture having learned something. She made this course really enjoyable, especially for those of us who had no prior computer science experience",
      "Angelica is super sweet and patient. I love her lectures and I did learn something in her class!",
      "Angelica is a really nice prof. You can tell that she is very passionate about computing science. She even gave us cookies on the first day. All of us."

You can email him 24/7 for a reply within 5 minutes, and he creates entire program frameworks overnight from scratch for simple assignments. Huge Industry exp.",
      "Awesome professor. He was very enthusiastic during lecturers, you can tell he has a passion for what he does. He is great at helping his students and is willing to take time out of his busy schedule to meet with his students. 10/10 would recommend.",
      "Scott is the man! His lectures are informative and his tests are super clear. The assignments can get a little tough but he's always there for you if you need help.

      "Very nice, very enthusiastic, and very helpful.

He gives lots and lots of hints and genuinely wants everyone in the class to succeed. An excellent prof overall.",
      "Scott is amazing! I've never had a prof as helpful as hime in SFU. One time he literally stayed in CSIL from 4 till 9ish to help out with every student. Got tons of hints on exams and assignments. Also would reach out to students for extra help. If you could, take Java with him.",
      "He always gives hint probably every class. He always emails you back if you have a question. During the assignments he'll email at least 5 emails giving you hints and if you show up in lecture he'll practically give you the answer. Notes are so in dept that you don't even need the book and he's always in CSIL if you wanna ask him questions.",
      "Given it was his first term lecturing he was pretty successful. Mostly read off the slides. Encouraged questions during class, but would scoff at people who asked simple questions, pretty demeaning sometimes. The midterm and quizzes were fairly simple, and he would often tell us beforehand what specific questions to expect.",
      "Very enthusiastic, his lectures are interesting as he shares his experiences in the field to the class. Really nice guy and helps students as much as he can. He understands that not every student has the same back ground in computer programming and throws out many hints for those less experienced. Amazing professor, looking forward to more classes!",
      "Nice guy, super clear, and super helpful. I thought the class was surprisingly difficult so be prepared to work hard, I did well because of prior Java experience. His exams are challenging but he gives lots of hints as to their content during lectures.",
      "Awesome professor who is very enthusiastic in lecture and keeps it interesting with the occasional joke. He also gives hints on assignments and exams during lecture so it's a good idea to go. Very respondent to emails and will stay after hours to help you on assignments. He made CMPT 125 very easy and I highly recommend him.",
      "Not the most clear instructor, but puts his lecture slides online which helps. Very respondent to emails, and helpful in office hours. He also gives \"hints\" as to what will be on the exam and more or less tells you how to do the projects. I recommend him!"
